# Changelog

## Version 2.8.2. Updated for TPF v. 4.15.2.

**Is save compatible. Make a save indoors before before using this update.**

Was intended an update for fixing bugs, which were present in the older versions of TPF and TPF DE. Now you won't CTD if you knock down a soul gem trap in Snapleg Cave by using meelee weapon, bow or crossbow (yeah, oddly specific), some dragons won't be lazy as cats and will actually fight and Dragonsbane will actually deal its damage to dragons. By the way thank you very much for reports as two of these weren't reported by TPF users. :P :D

During the next update, which is going to be not save compatible, be ready for better, but more performance costly LOD. But it won't be as meaty as the first one we had. Also we are going to have some changes to flora and removal of two content mods - Darkend and Final Cataclysm. Darkend was giving me headache for some long time (so definitely not AE's assets fault), while the other one started just now and at this point I am not even sure when the problem was introduced. They have some invisible or broken objects in the game, which I can't fix anyhow (tried unpacking their BSAs, complete reinstallation, removal of outputs, looking even at reference count etc.) and noone knows the reason. Of course, if someone there actually knows the solution to this problem, feel free to report back.

## Version 2.8.1.

**Is save compatible. Make a save indoors before before using this update.**

## Version 2.8.

**New save is required.**

I believe at this point I have added, removed or changed everything I have ever wanted (if we don't count an artifact overhaul I am dreaming about and probably something else I will remember about when it comes), so let's hope that modders will give everyone a little break, I will give you a break and I will be able to just chill for a while, while maintaining and polishing and actually finally enjoying the list, while streaming it from time to time to get even closer to you.

This time welcome _Ghosts of the Tribunal_, which with some other complimenting mods will add content to Solstheim, while being not as annoying thanks to its professionally reduced cut, _College of Winterhold - Quest Expansion_, which will finally make us do what we are actually supposed to do in college - learn (who would have thought) - and _EVG Animation Variance_ and its patch, which will allow to traverse dungeons in more unique ways. Also let's not forget about DeltaRider's _Oblivion - An Atronach Forge Overhaul_ and _Arachnomancy - A Spider Scrolls Overhaul_, which together overhaul ones of the most underlooked mechanics in the game, while also giving some love to vampires with _Vampire Feeding Tweaks_.

And give applause to the overhauled [feedback survey version 2.0.](https://forms.gle/2AxB1oT9vnzvdYwD7)! As some of you may not know, I love to hear from people and make necessary changes to the list if those are asked for and actually needed. I hope this time I will see much more answers too to make even better feedback report for you all. Please, fill it only after getting acquainted with the newest version of the list. After some time I will definitely remind you about it and something else too...
