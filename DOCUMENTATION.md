# Documentation

## Getting Started

Select _Profiles_ option from the Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) menu, select
your TPF profile, which you use for playing (basic or performance version), and select _Copy_ on the
right side and then name the copied profile `The Phoenix Flavour -
Dragon’s Edition` (and add `(Performance)` to the name if you have copied the performance version of TPF).

---

## Interface (optional)

Create a separator and name it `INTERFACE EXTENDED` and place it
directly below the *INTERFACE* separator (and its mods). Change its
colour, so that it won't be the same as TPF's ones.

All of the following mods in this category will be placed under this
separator in the same order.

This category's mods are optional - you can just skip it or install the
mods you like. There will be instructions on files, which are needed, if
you have decided to use one or more mods. Other sections mods (excluding the _Music & Sound FX_ section of the add-on) are all obligatory and can't be skipped.

### [ReCleaned Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26680)

**Main files** - ReCleanedMenus

*I prefer the vanilla-style main menu. It also doesn’t mess up so much
with the beautiful background.*

### [Centaur Font](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14356)

**Main files** - Centaur Font SSE

*Sovngarde font looks a little bit cartoonish to me, while Centaur font
is looking good within Skyrim's theme and is more usual, but not too
ordinary.*

### [12th Century Book Font](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72159)

**Main files** - Font

*Replaces font in Skyrim's books to look not as modern, more
sophisticated.*

### [Consolas Font - Sovngarde Font - 12th Century Book Font Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51973)

**Needed if you use TPF's default Sovngarde font and 12th Century
Book Font.**

**Optional files** - Consolas Font - Sovngarde Font - 12th Century
Book Font Patch

### [Consolas Font - Centaur Font - 12th Century Book Font Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51973)

**Needed if you use both Centaur Font and 12th Century Book Font.**

**Optional files** - Consolas Font - Centaur Font - 12th Century Book
Font Patch

### [Better SkyUI Config](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49095)

**Main files** - Better SkyUI Config

*Changes default SkyUI's sorting to be more user friedly by sorting all items by their type, active effects by their expiration time and by making equipped items grouped right at the top.*

### [SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252)

**Main files** - SmoothCam

**FOMOD** - if you have a modern CPU, choose `SmoothCam AVX`, `SmoothCam
SSE` otherwise, then `ESL`.

**Instructions** - rename the mod’s plugin to *SmoothCam.esp*.

*Have you ever been in a situation, when you were playing in third
person mode and fighting your enemy and you thought that you would land
your arrow or a spell on the enemy, because your crosshair was right on
them, but Skyrim has decided otherwise... Then this is a mod for you.*

### [iHUD - SmoothCam Automated Compatibility Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51918)

**Not needed without SmoothCam. Recommended with it.**

**Main files** - iHUD - SmoothCam Automated Compatibility Patch

*SmoothCam has its own crosshair, which appears right, when you aim. We
need this patch to disable our basic crosshair not to confuse us, while
we are trying to shoot, roast, electrocute, freeze etc. things.*

### [SmoothCam - Octavian's Preset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43927)

**Not needed without SmoothCam. Recommended with it.**

**Main files** - SmoothCam - Octavian's Preset 1.1.2

*I have tried many presets and this one feels great for playing the
game, especially for our cause - aiming in third person mode.*

### [Quick Loot RE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21085)

**Main files** - QuickLootRE

*One of the best additions to Fallout 4 (FO4) was the looting menu,
which appears right when you move your cursor over lootable item without
need to open game's full menu. This mod allows us to use this addition,
but in Skyrim.*

### [No Lockpick Activate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26790)

**Needed if you want to use Quick Loot RE.**

**Main files** - No Lockpick Activate (SKSE) - Updated

*Fixes game's and looting menu mod's interaction, where you would be
forced into the full menu upon unlocking container. It also affects
every other locked object, so, for example, you have to interact with
doors after unlocking them to open them.*

### [Minimalist Quick Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45581)

**Not needed without Quick Loot RE. Optional with it.**

**Main files** - Minimalist Quick Loot

**FOMOD** - Whatever options you like.

*Useful to make Quick Loot's interface smaller and less bulky by making
it transparent.*

### [moreHUD Inventory Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18619)

**Main files** - moreHUD Inventory Edition Loose Version

*It makes you aware of known weapon and armor enchantments, books you
have read and it tells you about which kind of skill you can level by
reading book.*

### [Alternate Conversation Camera](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21220)

**Main files** - Alternate Conversation Camera

**INI** - In line 51, change _bLetterBox_ to `0`, in line 68, change _bHideDialogueMenu_ to `1`.

*Another FO4 like addition to Skyrim, which makes conversations look
much more lively.*

### [Pastel SkyUI Markers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13604)

**Main files** - Pastel SkyUI SkyHUD

*Makes markers on the map and the compass more distinguishable, while making them also better to look at.*

### [Detailed Mine Markers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3172)

**Main files** - Detailed Mine Markers v1.4

**FOMOD** - Whatever options you like, except one you need to use - `Install USSEP Compatibility`. I recommend lore friendly markers with an aditions of new markers for mines.

*Finally I won't need to ask Google about where can I get specific kind of ore. It is enough to use the search functionality in our map.*

### [Werewolf Transformation Timer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45326)

**Main files** - Werewolf Transformation Timer

*You will finally know how much time you have left before you need to
find another body to feed and not to think about it every single time
you transform into werewolf.*

---

## New Content

The beast of this add-on comes too early (well, for me it came as the
last one, but you got the idea). The point of this section is to add
content to our beloved Skyrim to make the game even more interesting. I
won’t write any descriptions of mods (if you don’t count the gameplay
guide at the end) as I don’t want to spoil the fun (and because I am too
lazy at this point and just want to play a bit). And why should I? These
mods talk for themselves. They will be great adjustments to already
existing content and some of these are the most popular and loved quest
mods in Nexus Skyrim Special Edition’s page, so I hope you are hyped the
same way as I was (and still am).

Create a separator and name it `NEW CONTENT` and place it directly below
the *WEATHER* separator (and its mods). Change its colour, so that it
won't be the same as TPF's ones.

All of the following mods in this category will be placed under this
separator in the same order.

### [Winterhold Deep Sea Ruins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53707?tab=files)

### [Boethiah for Good Guys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/329?tab=files)

**Main files** - Main File

Wanted to leave some comments here and there for the future, when you
will learn what mods do.

*I know, I know, you can make debates about this mod being immersive or
not. But you can kick Boethiah out of their cloud of thinking that
everyone is just going to murder for them alone and at the same time not
kill our improved followers. Win-win situation for me.*

### [Thieves Guild For Good Guys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10745?tab=files)

**Main files** - Thieves Guild For Good Guys - Taking Care of Business
Redux 4.0

### [Save The Dark Brotherhood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33461?tab=files)

**Main files** - Save the Dark Brotherhood 1.1

*Unfortunately, it won’t be canon, but let’s be honest - without at
least a bunch of the members, The Dark Brotherhood feels like The Dark
Dragonborn, so give me a chance to save more of the members especially
considering the previous mod we have added.*

*Well, he is one of the main villains of the game (and possibly the
follower), so he, like all others, deserves attention too. What is funny
is that he looks very similar to my nord character preset, just
younger.*

## Landscape

Phoenix is definitely a master at choosing and mixing different landscape elements to make it as beautiful as we can experience in TPF, 
but a few gems added in this will definitely make our surroundings even more breath-taking.  

Create a separator and name it `LANDSCAPE EXTENDED` and place it
directly below the *TREES & PLANTS* separator (and its mods). Change its
colour, so that it won't be the same as TPF's ones.

All of the following mods in this category will be placed under this
separator in the same order.

### [Official Unique Flowers and Plants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29154)

**Optional files** - Unique Flowers and Plants for Skyrim SE DLC
Compatible ESM Version

**Hide** - hide `JuniperBush.nif` and `SloeBush.nif` by right-clicking
the mod, then choosing the _Conflicts_ tab, selecting two files on the
_Winning file conflicts_ section, right-clicking on them and choosing
_Hide_.*

*Adds different beautiful hand-placed flowers and plants around Skyrim
to make it more interesting and picturesque. ESM plugin allows us not to
worry about the mod overwriting anything we don't want to.*

### [Cathedral - 3D Mountain Flowers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41312)

**Main files** - Cathedral - 3D Mountain Flowers

**Hide (not now, later, when you will get to the *PREPARATIONS*
section)** - hide any file, which overwrites _Fixed Mesh Lightning_. Don’t
worry, there will be a reference to these instructions in the
*PREPARATIONS* section.

*Who would even like to look at vanilla mountain flowers, if we have
these.*

### [A Patch for Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes and Cathedral Mountain Flowers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50265)

**Main files** - A Patch for Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes and
Cathedral Mountain Flowers

**Optional files** - A Patch for Lanterns of Skyrim II and Cathedral
Mountain Flowers

### [Butterflies Land True](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29434)

**Optional files** - Butterflies Land True - ESPFE Alternate Version

*At first, I didn't want to waste any resources (even if there is nothing too much needed) on anything like this and the next mod, but after seeing a butterfly somehow sitting in the air, while it was supposed to be sitting on a cabbage, I have changed by mind.*

### [Butterflies Unchained](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29538)

**Main files** - Butterflies Unchained (ESL Version)

### [Rorikstead Basalt Cliffs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25718)

**Main files** - Rorikstead Basalt Cliffs

*By adding some unique things to regions of Skyrim like this one, we can definitely achieve our goal of making Skyrim a majestic land it is supposed to be.*


### [Little Touches - A tree Placement for Whiterun City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54411)

**Main files** - AIO-LT- A Tree Placement for Whiterun City

*Without Whiterun, Skyrim woudn't have been the same game, so let's give Whiterun some love it deserves.*


### [Farmhouse Chimneys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8766)

**Main files** - Farmhouse Chimneys SE v4.0.5

**FOMOD** - `Wyrmstooth, Helgen Reborn`.

*Let's not poison our poor, old NPCs with carbon monoxide.*

---

## Apparel & Weapons

Nothing much as you will get plenty of goodies from new and old quests -
just some new weapons to our favourite NPCs to show their status and
power and different looking variants of gear for players.

Create a separator and name it `APPAREL & WEAPONS EXTENDED` and place it
directly below the *APPAREL & WEAPONS* separator (and its mods). Change
its colour, so that it won't be the same as TPF's ones.

All of the following mods in this category will be placed under this
separator in the same order.

You will need to make an account on another modding website (yes, there
isn’t just *Nexus*, but not many other services are as reliable) called
[VectorPlexus](https://vectorplexus.com/), because three mods,
which we need for completion of the add-on, are available only from
there. Be warned that much content there is NSFW related, so if you
don’t want to see that, just make an account and follow my instructions.

While you are logged in and when you will open a link to the website
from here, there will be a button *Download this file*. If mod has
different versions, there will be instructions on which one to get like
always.

### [Elemental Staffs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5319)

**Main files** - Elemental Staffs SE

**Optional files** - Elemental Staffs SE Basic

**Merge** - Merge both files.

*Alters the appearance of almost all staffs to appear more like they are
imbued with the power of magic we are actually using them for.*

### [KD Circlets Redone by zzjay](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10320)

**Main files** - KD Cirlets by zzjay main file

*At first, I wasn’t a fan, because if we compare this mod to JS Circlet
Replacer, the replacer is definitely the winner, but after looking more
at some of these minimalistic and sweet circlets, I have decided that a
bunch of people will use them. They can be obtained only by crafting at
forge.*

### [Heavy Armored Pants](https://vectorplexus.com/files/file/404-heavy-armored-pants/)

*You will be able to get these in exchange for their counterparts (heavy
armors) in Skyrim. Just use any forge for that. Tempered the same way as
any other armor, pants have the same stats as their counterparts.*

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37147270/130328192-84efd439-a1bd-4893-a77d-989d9c48799c.png)

### [Royal Armory - New Artifacts Plugin Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44392)

**Main files** - Royal Armory - Replacer

**FOMOD** - `Obscure’s College of Winterhold - Cell Setting Patch`.

--- 

## Gameplay Overhauls

This section is intended to compliment TPF's gameplay and combat overhauls with a touch of immersiveness by adding new, not intrusive mechanics or by changing already existing ones.

Create a separator and name it `GAMEPLAY OVERHAULS EXTENDED` and place it
directly below the *COMBAT & ENCOUNTERS* separator (and its mods). Change its
colour, so that it won't be the same as TPF's ones.

All of the following mods in this category will be placed under this
separator in the same order.

### [Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099)

**Main files** - Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul

**FOMOD** - Don’t change anything.

**Instructions** - Disable *Adamant - Shrines and Amulets* in the _Gameplay Overhauls_ section and _Miscellaneous Tweaks Collection - Shrines Don't Cure Diseases_.

*In the Elder Scrolls universe everything is connected to different kinds of deities, so it isn't a surprise that Skyrim's people are ardent believers. Let's make religion more important for our player character too.*

### [C.O.I.N. - Coins of Interesting Natures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51439)

**Main files** - C.O.I.N.

**FOMOD** - `Author's Choice, Auto Conversion Enabled, The Tools of Kagrenac, WACCF, USSEP`.

*Finally draugr aren't stealing any septims around Skyrim and bringing them to crypts. Only fruits and vegetables from time to time as an offering for ... themselves? Maybe someone else.*

### [Smart NPC Potions - Enemies Use Potions and Poisons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40102)

**Main files** - Smart NPC Potions

*Finally bandits, mages and assassins will also have an option to have
and use some potions. And not just healing potions, which they already
use, to make our lives a little bit harder. Everything, for instance, a
chance of them having a potion, is configurable by MCM.*

### [Scion - Vampiric Sunscreen Plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42212)

**Main files** - Scion - Vampiric Sunscreen Plugin

*If you wear any type of headgear, while being outdoors, like our
vampire friend Serana does, you won’t be destroyed by sun damage.*

### [More Werewolves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7259)

**Main files** - More Werewolves

*Yes, more werewolves will be in Skyrim, so be attentive especially when
traversing the area around Morthal.*

**FOMOD** - `Standalone version, RFYL Patch`.

### [Canis Hysteria - The Werewolf Disease](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52397)

**Main files** - Canis Hysteria

**FOMOD** - `Improved Companions - Questline Tweaks`.

*Finally you can become a werewolf without joining the Companions if you aren’t the type in the immersive way.*

### [Werewolf Aela](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29155)

**Main files** - Werewolf Companions v1.3 FOMOD

**FOMOD** - `No Facial Edits, Aela’s Transformation Only for 3 Minutes
and 45 Minutes`.

*Has it always bothered you that Companions can’t turn into werewolves
or do that only during Companions quests? Well, me too. This mod makes
Aela transform into werewolf, if she is badly hurt. Aela will always
want to stay as werewolf, not like Farkas and Vilkas, who can be cured,
so I have decided that it will be enough just with her.*

### [Catir’s College Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44557)

**Main files** - Catir's College Creatures

*Now you will actually need to use magic to beat the College of
Winterhold quest line. You have been warned, don’t sneak peek at the
description of the mod.*

### [No Lock Picking](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32218)

**Main files** - NoLockPicking v2

*Removes the lock picking mini-game (annoying) from the game and now
actually uses your lockpicking skill to open doors and chests.*

### [Reading is Good](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42026)

**Main files** - Reading Is Good SE

*Makes us smarter in an immersive way by giving us a permanent boost to a leveling speed in a skill, which we have read about.*

### [Dragonborn - Shouts Perk Tree](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41950)

**Main files** - Dragonborn - Shouts Perk Tree

**Miscellaneous files** - Dragonborn - Adamant Patch

*Being Dragonborn and being able to shout should make us more unique
than other characters, and this mod does that by giving us experience
and perk points for shouting and killing dragons and a unique skill tree
for spending these.*

### [Angi's Camp Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44914)

**Main files** - Angi's Camp Tweaks

*Quality of life changes for Agni’s training session.*

---

## Miscellaneous

This category's mods are focused on adding some quality of life tools
and changes to the game. In many situations, these mods won't even
bother you in any way if you aren't actually using them, so I decided
not to make this section optional as it isn't intrusive as *INTERFACE*,
which changes things you will always see (and I don't want to make
separate patches for this bulky section).

Create a separator and name it `MISCELLANEOUS EXTENDED` and place it
directly below the *MISCELLANEOUS* separator (and its mods). Change its
colour, so that it won't be the same as TPF's ones.

All of the following mods in this category will be placed under this
separator in the same order.

### [powerofthree's Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)

**Main files** - Papyrus Extender SSE - 4.5.1

*Plugin that extends Skyrim's script language (Papyrus) functionality.
It will be needed for Strange Runes to use another version of runes for
dual-casted spells.*  

### [UIExtensions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17561)

**Main files** - UIExtensions v1-2-0

*Resource for modders to use to make custom menus for their mods. We
will need it for AddItemMenu mod.*

### [Custom Skills Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780)

**Main files** - Custom Skills Framework v1

*.NET Script Framework’s plugin for making custom skill trees for our
character, will be used for a mod, which will greatly enhance gameplay
with shouts together with Forceful Tongue - Shouts Overhaul.*

### [HDT-SMP (Skinned Mesh Physics)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30872)

**Main files** - HDT-SMP for SSE 1.5.97 v2.11

*SKSE plugin, which will allow us to use physics for our PC, like in our
scenario, with moving hair. Bonk people, who thought about something
else.*

### [Mfg Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11669)

**Main files** - MfgFix

*Just a couple of fixes for Skyrim’s facial animation scripts, which
will be needed by Conditional Expressions.*

### [Copy and Paste in Console](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30928)

**Main files** - Copy and Paste in Console v1.0.1 for Skyrim SE

**INI** - In line 2, change _PasteKeyCode_ to `47`, so you will need
standard _Ctrl+V_ command to paste something to your console.

*A neat functionality in one mod (very weird that Bethesda haven't
thought about adding it, well, like always), which you will probably use
from time to time.*

### [More Growable Plants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3880)

**Optional files** - More Growable Plants Simple 1.5

**Hide (not now, later, when you will get to the PREPARATIONS
section)** - hide any file, which overwrites _Fixed Mesh Lightning_.

*Still no idea where citizens of Skyrim get their apples, tomatoes,
garlic and many other things from, but at least we know where we can get
them from. And don’t worry, I have patched it, so you will be able to
grow only things I consider to be immersive to be grown.*

### [3D Mountain Flowers Hearthfire Planters Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49113)

**Main files** - More Growable Plants_3D Mountain Flowers patch

### [Enhanced Blood Textures - ENB Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2357)

**Main files** - enb square test alpha test test file v31

**Delete** - Remove `dD-Larger Splatter Size.esp` and `dD-Reduced Splatter Size.esp`.

*This fix is going to help us resolve weird blood sqare effect, which sometimes appear, when blood is on a surface.*

### [Bright Waterfall Fix for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37956)

**Main files** - Bright Waterfall Fix for Realistic Water Two

**Optional files** - DynDOLOD Bright LOD Waterfall Fix

**Merge** - Merge both files.

*I can’t stand waterfalls being too bright at night.*

### [Particle Lights for ENB - Nordic Ruins Candles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52335)

**Main files** - Particle Lights for ENB - Nordic Ruins Candles

*Where is a petition that everything needs to be patched for ENB to look
magnificent? I would have signed it.*

### [ENB Lava Particle Light Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54657)

**Main files** - ENB Lava Particle Light Patch

### [Strange Runes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19456)

**Main files** - Strange Runes

**Update files** - Strange Runes

**Merge** - Merge both files.

*Great for screenshots and makes magic feel even more unique. MCM (Mod
Configuration Menu) available, so you can make them appear only for some
specific spell group etc. You need it! Just look at my
character.*

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37147270/130328931-2f92e74c-1a43-4696-8404-0f2cf1a8c222.png)

### [Dragonborn Presence](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25287)

**Main files** - Dragonborn Presence

**Instructions** - Install the mod, right-click *Data* folder and select
*Set as data directory*, click *OK*. Right-click the mod in your
*Downloads* tab and select *Open File*, move *discord-rpc.dll* file to
the game's root folder.

*Allows your friends in Discord to see that you are actually really busy
looting Nazeem's house.*

### [Simple Load Screens](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49529)

**Main files** - Simple Load Screens

*Replaces stale, not eye-catching loading screens with new ones with
lore-friendly artwork of Skyrim and what it has to offer. At least
people, who have to wait longer on them, will be pleased.*

### [Look What You See](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19189)

**Main files** - Look what you see

**FOMOD** - `ESL`.

**Instructions** - rename the mod’s plugin to `TissHeadTrack.esp`.

**If you installed Alternate Conversation Camera** - go to _Alternate
Conversation Camera_'s INI, in line 47, change _bConversationHT_ to `0`.

*Head tracking mod, which makes our player character (PC) observe
things, which we move our cursor on.*

### [First Person Camera Height Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28091)

**Main files** - First Person Camera Height Fix

*Who would have thought that High Elves are actually high. I thought
they just named themselves like that. One other mod, which we will
install later, will greatly help us in using this mod’s capabilities.*

### [Diziet's Auto Outfits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40801)

**Main files** - Diziet's Auto Outfits

**FOMOD** - don’t change anything.

*The mod makes you automatically change your outfit according to
different conditions, which can be configured inside the mod's MCM. For
example, I use it to change my default gear to ordinary clothing with
speech etc. enchantments for traders, when I am inside big cities.
Otherwise I will probably forget to do that.*

### [Serio's Cycle Hotkeys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27184)

**Main files** - Serio's Cycle Hotkeys

*Makes it possible to adjust one hotkey to equip not just one spell or
option, but different sets of things. For instance, if I am a mage, I
can use my first hotkey to equip Ice Storm spell in both hands and Ice
Form shout to battle with melee enemies, then press my second hotkey to
get my ward spell and Thunderbolt to deal with that pesky bandit mage.
You can set whatever buttons you want as these hotkeys. Pretty detailed
instructions on how to use the mod can be found in the mod's page.*

### [Hide Your Quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50125)

**Main files** - Hide Your Quests 1.0.1

*Successor of the mod Hide Those Futile Quests, which gives you an
option to hide a quest you will do later from your journal by using
MCM.*

### [Forget Spell](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51125)

**Main files** - Forget Spell

**FOMOD** - `Skyrim Special Edition, SkyUI`.

*Another neat addition - allows us to forget spells we won't use
anymore. Why would I need to clutter my menu with Flames, while I am
level 80 mage. You will see an option to forget spells in your spells
menu.*

## Music & Sound FX (optional)

Create a separator and name it `MUSIC & SOUND FX EXTENDED` and place it
directly below the *SOUND FX* separator (and its mods). Change its
colour, so that it won't be the same as TPF's ones.

All of the following mods in this category will be placed under this
separator in the same order.

This category's mods are optional - you can just skip the category. You
can use whatever mods you like, which are before a horizontal line, but
you will need to install all of the music mods, which are behind the
line, if you want everything to work correctly. Music is actually the
same one Phoenix offers in her TPF-X, so all credit goes to those
wonderful people, who made it, and Phoenix for finding these pearls and
making a patch for them. And a reminder that other sections mods (excluding the _Interface_ section of the add-on) are all obligatory and can't be skipped.

## Appearance

Overall, I am happy with TPF’s appearance section, but the humanoid
player character’s skin texture choice is not as good as it doesn’t give
you many choices for experimenting (or maybe I just prefer other ones,
no idea), so I am changing that with different textures, by using which
everyone is probably going to find his or her favourite combinations to
play with. Other changes are there to diversify different races of
Skyrim’s population and make character creation a little bit more
interesting and even more time-consuming.

Create a separator and name it `APPEARANCE EXTENDED` and place it
directly below the *SKELETON & ANIMATIONS* separator (and its mods).
Change its colour, so that it won't be the same as TPF's ones.

All of the following mods in this category will be placed under this
separator in the same order.

### [SavrenX Vampire Lord Tank](https://vectorplexus.com/files/file/271-savrenx-vampire-lord-tank/)

*When I saw Harkon for the first time, well, it was a little bit sad
that Vampire Lord looks like a noodle. And with that mass, he probably
looked awkward, when he used melee combat against us. Let’s separate
Vampire Lords even more from senile ordinary vampires.*

### [Racial Body Morphs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20684)

**Main files** - Racial Body Morphs 2.0

*Finally you will find out why we needed that First
Person Camera Height Fix. All races from this point will have their own
unique height and form, so wish some luck to Wood Elves at getting any
attention from HIGH Elves. And now you will think twice before touching
that big orc. Really lore-immersive mod.*

### [Tempered Skins for Males](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7902)

**Main files** - Tempered Skins for Males - Dressed Version

**FOMOD** - `A2 and F none`, for other things you can choose whatever
options you like. `My recommendations - B3 (people are living in Skyrim,
not Elsweyr), C3, D2, E1 (with this combination they don’t look too old
and at the same time not as teenagers)`.

*I guess Tempered Skins is my favourite mod series, when it comes to
appearance, as each of the skins for both males and females is so
customizable you won’t need any other mod. And that’s why I also give
you a choice to make in FOMOD.*

### [Masculine Khajiit Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/186)

**Main files** - Grey Cat and Leopard Vanilla v1.1 - 2K Res Pack

**FOMOD** - `Grey Cat, Abs`.

Yes, you have read it right. For one other mod to work correctly, we
will need to choose a different version of Masculine Khajiit Textures.

**Rename** - Rename it to `Masculine Khajiit Textures - TPF Dragon’s Edition` to install it as a separate mod.

### [Masculine Argonian Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/185)

**Main files** - Masculine Chameleon and Lizard (Vanilla) 2K

**FOMOD** - `Lizard, Heavy Scales`.

*I don’t see anything too eye-catching from Forgotten Argonian Roots and
they don’t work with the mod, so let’s use argonian skin texture from
the same author, which textures we use for Khajiits.*

### [Tempered Skins for Females](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8505)

**Main files** - Tempered Skins for Females UNP and Vanilla

**FOMOD** - `A7 and F none`, for other things you can choose whatever
options you like. `My recommendations - B01, C2, D1, E2`.

### [Feminine Khajiit Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/183)

**Main files** - Feminine Grey Cat and Leopard (Vanilla) 2K

**FOMOD** - `Grey Cat, Abs`.

**Main files** - Sandow Plus Plus - Ripped Bodies

**Main files** - Sandow Plus Plus - Ripped Bodies - Males

**Main files** - Sandow Plus Plus - Ripped Bodies - UNP

**FOMOD** - `Choose every option in all these 3 mods (exception is in one
place in the file for males, where you need to choose vanilla type of
body, then again every race)`.

*The weight slider in Racemenu will also make us more ripped, not just
bigger.*

### [Just No Tails](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5051)

**Main files** - Nooo Mooore Taiiiiiils

*Actually, before I really couldn't understand why people wanted to
remove tails from Khajiits and Argonians, but after playing with them
for some time now I do. Gear wasn’t made with them in mind (and it would
have been such a bother to do), so the sight of our tail clipping
through armor looks awkward. The best and the most easy solution is just
to hide tails.*

### [Grimoas Plantigrade Feet For Beast Races](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16976)

**Main files** - Grimoas Plantigrade Feet For Beast Races v 1_4

**Delete** - delete `Gri_BeastFeet.esp`.

*A resource from Skyrim LE to make our next mod work (thank you very
much).*

**Main files** - Barefoot Beast Project

*Now we won’t need to imagine anymore how our poor Argonian puts those
little boots on.*

### [BeastHHBB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38480)

**Main files** - BeastHHBB - Player Character only

*Many appearance mods have one thing in common - they almost always forget about poor beast races. 
But not this one as it adds many options exlusively for them to make their look more unique.*

### [High Poly Head](https://vectorplexus.com/files/file/283-high-poly-head/)

High_Poly_Head_v1.4\_(SE).zip

**FOMOD** - `BSA Only, Special Edition, Expressive Facegen Morphs,
Expressive Facial Animation (both), High Poly Vanilla Hair, Vampire Head
Fix, Symmetrical Eyes (Female)`.

*With this your dreams of making an even more perfect face for your
character shouldn't wait for long anymore.*

### [KS Hairdos Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1932)

**Main files** - KS Hairdos SMP

*New level of fanciness. People love hair with physics, so let them be.*

## ANIMATIONS

At first, you will need to change Simple Dual Sheath INI to make OUR
shield appear on the back, because later we will make our placement for
both our arrows’ and bolts’ quivers to be on our waistline’s back, which
I believe will look much better in this combination than vanilla
placement.

Like you can see in the screenshots, it looks much less clunky than a
bow being together with a quiver and clipping through each other and
much more likely than us carrying our shield in our hand for all day.

<p align="center">
   <img width="52.5%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37147270/130330553-da6655dd-391c-4add-abb7-910df3477896.png" /> 
   <img width="45%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37147270/130330545-ca979529-70c6-46d3-b9b6-2832bc90b5e3.png" />
</p>

Overall through animations we will add more life and uniqueness into our
player character. NPCs are untouched by these different gear locations,
so we won’t have to worry about manually adjusting each NPC’s look. And,
as the obligatory part, the mods we are going to add will make us use
dual sheath animations.

**INI in Simple Dual Sheath** - In line 23, change *Flags* to
`Player|FirstPerson`, then in line 38, change *DisableHideOnSit* to
`Player|MountOnly`.

Create a separator and name it `ANIMATIONS EXTENDED` and place it
directly below the *APPEARANCE EXTENDED* separator (and its mods).
Change its colour, so that it won't be the same as TPF's ones.

All of the following mods in this category will be placed under this
separator in the same order.

### [Undeath - XPMSSE - Strange Runes - Skeleton Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50694)

**Main files** - Undeath - XPMSSE - Strange Runes - Skeleton Patch

*If we don’t overwrite one of the XP32MSSE skeleton’s with this one, our
character in some scenarios would have been invisible and their spell
runes would have appeared near their feet, so let’s put it here.*

### [Ultimate Combat and Creature Behaviour's Nemesis Compatibility](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45966)

**Main files** - Undead summons emerge from the ground

*I know that undead work a little bit differently in the Elder Scrolls
universe, but it still doesn’t make sense for soul’s physical form to
appear out of thin air, so here we go.*

### [Vampire Lord - Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54441)

### [Jog & Sprint](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15881)

**Main files** - Jog Sprint and Jump

**Hide** - hide any file, which overwrites _Jump Behavior Overhaul_ by
right-clicking the mod, then choosing the *Conflicts* tab, selecting all
the files on the *Winning file conflicts* section, where overwritten mod
includes *Jump Behavior Overhaul*, right-clicking on them and choosing
*Hide*.

*Realistic animations for sprinting and running.*

**Main files** - Crouch Sliding - Remove Ragdolling for Good

even know that it was there in the first place.*

### [TK Dodge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15309)

**Main files** - TK Dodge SE

**Main files** - Replace to Step Dodge

**Merge** - merge both files.

*Gives you an ability to sidestep, dodge attacks. Just press the
directional key two times to dodge in that direction. I chose the side
step version, because I don’t see characters with heavy armour rolling
around at all, even in this fantasy world, but sidestep is alright.*

## NPC OVERHAULS

As you probably understood (I hope), this project definitely goes over
vanilla+ mark (of course, you are using all those mods, what do you even
talk about...) and I understand that too. With this category of mods I
just want Skyrim to look a little bit more classy, modern. It is a
fantasy game with magic, dragons, other mythical creatures and so many
things I will have to write millions of words to describe. Do you really
want to spend your money on a game to look at silly faces and then play
while looking at those, when you have an option to change that? And also
I believe that in my game - fantasy, where I decide what will happen -
everyone has the right to look decent and appealing to my eyes (don't
have any experience where someone criticized the _too good_ looks of an
actress for a specific movie or a character in a game). So here we go.

Create a separator and name it `NPC OVERHAULS` and place it directly
below the *FINAL PATCHES* separator (and its mods). Change its colour,
so that it won't be the same as TPF's ones.

All of the following mods in this category will be placed under this
separator in the same order.

In some scenarios we are going to hide some files from specific
overhauls, because even considering the fact I have sorted overhauls
relying on overall preference there are some exceptions I like more. For
example, I love Evette San’s look from a mod called *The Ordinary
Women*, but a mod called *Kalilies NPCs* is overwriting it with it’s own
looks. So to make Evette from The Ordinary Women appear we are hiding
her facegen files from Kalilies NPCs to make sure that the game loads
needed files and my custom made plugin for our overhauls makes sure that
The Ordinary Women wins the conflict on loads data of the Ordinary Women
correctly.

If you don't understand or want to know what will happen if you do
something incorrectly, here you go. You have probably heard about the
issue once or twice - black face bug. CTDs can happen if overhaul uses
unique body parts (like The Ordinary Women) and you enter into the place
where this incorrect NPC is.

### [High Poly Expressive NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41107)

**Main files** - High Poly Expressive NPCs - Nordic Faces

**Miscellaneous files** - WACCF Patch

**Hide facegen files** - Double click on the mod in your mod order,
switch to *Conflicts* tab, at the right side of *Winning file conflicts*
there will be a filter, write `Simple Children` into it, hide all appeared files.

*Very good base to start our NPC overhauling.*

### [Shield Sisters Re-Imagined](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44243)

**Main files** - Shield Sisters Re-Imagined UNP

**Update files** - Iona Jordis Illia Hotfix

**Hide facegen files** - Double click on the mod in your mod order,
switch to *Conflicts* tab, at the right side of *Winning file conflicts*
there will be a filter, copy `00013478` into it, hide two appeared
files.

*One of the newest additions to NPC overhauls of Skyrim, which spices
things up. Has Bijin series’ mods vibes, but feels more unique.*

### [Pandorable’s NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19012)

**Main files** - Pandorable's NPCs SE

**FOMOD** - `USSEP` (Pandorable has probably forgotten to change name from
LE's Unofficial Patch in her FOMOD), `no warpaint only for Voldsea`.

*Pandorable's overhauls are definitely one of the best ones as they not
only cover the most notable NPCs of Skyrim, but also give each of them a
bit of charisma.*

And now there will be many, many patches for our mod overhauls and the
mod *AI Overhaul* (which is dope by the way). I don’t know why, but
someone in Bethesda has thought that it would be a good idea that AI

## Salt & Wind Hair Retextures

Now we will make our hair mods (and some of our overhauled NPCs’ hairs)
blend a little bit better with vanilla ones.

Create a separator and name it `SALT & WIND HAIR RETEXTURES` and place
it directly below the *NPC OVERHAULS* separator (and its mods). Change
its colour, so that it won't be the same as TPF's ones.

All of the following mods in this category will be placed under this
separator in the same order.

## Literally Unplayable

Briefly, mods we are going to install are going to help us mask head parts from mods we have installed before 
not to mess up with our game. How can they mess up the game? For instance, just by cluttering up your Racemenu.
And making your hair dissapear or making even more problems if you have used an appearance asset from the mod you weren't supposed to and then removed it. 
Also do you remember the mod Ordinary Women mod we have talked about and how its head parts can crash the game?
So guess what will happen if you equip that head part to your character.

Create a separator and name it `LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE` and place
it directly below the *SALT & WIND HAIR RETEXTURES* separator (and its mods). Change
its colour, so that it won't be the same as TPF's ones.

## Final Patches

Create a separator and name it `TPF DRAGON’S EDITION - FINAL PATCHES`
and place it directly below the *SALT & WIND HAIR RETEXTURES* separator
(and its mods). Change its colour, so that it won't be the same as TPF's
ones.

All of the following mods in this category will be placed under this
separator in the same order.

I have decided to make patches modular, so it is faster and easier for
me to check things inside. As mentioned before, that doesn't mean you can suddenly grab whatever you want from here and just use that.

## Alternate Start

Create a separator and name it `ALTERNATE START` and place it directly
below the *TPF DRAGON’S EDITION - FINAL PATCHES* separator (and its
mods). Change its colour, so that it won't be the same as TPF's ones.

### [Ralof or Hadvar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14553)

**Main files** - Ralof or Hadvar (saved in form 44)

*Skips the carriage drive and makes us enter right into Helgen’s Keep
with Ralof or Hadvar. In some way it isn't an alternate start, but at
the same time it is. What matters is this mod’s simplicity, which allows
us to jump right into the action.*

## Patcher Output

Create a separator and name it `TPF DRAGON’S EDITION - PATCHER OUTPUT`
and place it directly below the *PATCHER OUTPUT* separator (and its
outputs). Change its colour, so that it won't be the same as TPF's ones.

All of the following mods in this category will be placed under this
separator in the same order.

After enabling these outputs, disable TPF’s outputs.

## Preparations

And finally it is almost the end of the guide. Only some things to do,
so let’s get it done.

At first, we will need to reinstall some of TPF mods to leave TPF as
clean as we can and to get patches we need.

Open *Fixes* separator of the TPF, find the mod *NARC Remade - No
Animals Report Crimes*, right click on it and press *Reinstall Mod*,
rename the mod to `NARC Remade - No Animals Report Crimes - TPF Dragon’s
Edition`, then in FOMOD choose core file NARC with patches for Bruma,
Darkend, The Forgotten City and The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal, put the mod
right after the mod from TPF and activate it.

The same process must be done with:

-   *Fixed Mesh Lightning* in *GRAPHICS BASELINE* separator - TPFs
    patches [(look
    here)](https://thephoenixflavour.com/tpf/mod-installation/graphics-baseline/#fomod-instructions-2)
    and `More Growable Plants, flora for Beyond Skyrim - Bruma, Unique Flowers and
    Plants, 3D Mountain Flowers, flora for Bruma, ice for Bruma, creatures for Bruma, Grahl`;

-   Now go to files with **Hide (not now, later, when you will get to the
    PREPARATIONS section)** by using [this](https://github.com/DragonBlame/tpf-dragons-edition/blob/dev/DOCUMENTATION.md#cathedral---3d-mountain-flowers) and do what is asked;

-   *Lanterns of Skyrim II* in *LANDSCAPE* separator - `SMIM and Bruma`;

-   *Particle Lights For ENB - Undead Creatures* in *CREATURES* -
    `Default undead eyes, weaker lightning for ghosts, a patch for
    Cannibal Draugr, red skulls, Solstheim version of the patch`, then
    delete `Clutter` folder inside _Meshes_;

-   *Simple Children - Patches* in *APPEARANCE* - `Bruma, Helgen Reborn,
    Interesting NPCs, Moon and Star, The Forgotten City, Wyrmstooth,
    Adopt Aventus Aretino + USSEP`;

-   *Misc. College of Winterhold Tweaks* in *IMPROVED VANILLA QUESTS* -
    TPFs patches [(look
    here)](https://thephoenixflavour.com/tpf/mod-installation/new-content/#fomod-instructions-3)
    except `Scheduled Savos, A Wizard’s Walk, Erratum Etc.`, which
    aren’t chosen by FOMOD too (just for you to be sure that is
    correct), and you should make sure that `Obscure’s College of
    Winterhold Add-on, Interesting NPCs Add-on`, `None` for *The Early
    Elementalist* are chosen. Then disable the original Misc. College
    of Winterhold Tweaks.

Then you will need to redownload one mod.

### [Simple Player Homes Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37236)

**Main files** - Simple Home Improvements AIO (Proudspire 4 Beds)

*Because we want more places for our many children to sleep, duh.*

Rename it to `Simple Player Homes Improvements - TPF Dragon’s Edition`
right when you are installing the mod. Put it after Simple Player Homes
Improvements in the _MISCELLANEOUS_ section.

After that is done, click anywhere in the load order panel and select
*Enable all*. Then...

### [TPF Dragon’s Edition - Load Order](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51973)

**Main files** - Load Order

I hope you remember what to do with this. If no - open the archive and
extract the _loadorder.txt_ to _Mod Organizer 2\profiles\The Phoenix
Flavour - Dragon’s Edition_.

---

## Configurations

And now we are ready to jump into the game, but don’t do it right away.

At the beginning, don’t be scared when you see that your character’s
hair and/or beard isn't right. Do you remember us installing High Poly
Head and its hair (and beard) variations, right? Well, Wabbajack users won't, but that isn't the point. Now we need to
actually activate our high poly head in Racemenu and then our hair will
look fine. Also choose a beard from High Poly Head and it will look good
if that is needed.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37147270/130331927-051552a4-64d6-420b-8fa4-e18fd232ee4e.png)

Then find the *Weapons* category and change settings to the same ones
you see below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37147270/130331938-43bb6a6b-dee2-439c-8fae-f3780a734c8a.png)

Later into the game, if you are planning to use shields and if you find
one, I recommend you to go into the console with ~ key, type
`showracemenu`, press *Enter* and make corrections to your shield’s
position using settings you can again see below. You can also experiment
with other shield or even two-handed weapon settings, but don’t
overdo these or animations will look funky. And for all our sakes - don't change your race, gender or name. After setting up the settings,
press *R* and *Enter* and you are done.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37147270/130331988-48ac8994-b096-4497-b261-9a9d32bb253a.png)

At first, when Ralof or Hadvar frees you, don’t go anywhere right away.
Wait a bit for everything to load (wait after all messages on the top
left side of the screen disappear).

Second, don’t forget about following Phoenix’s in-game configurations [here](https://thephoenixflavour.com/tpf/mod-configuration/) and also remember to turn the _Depth of Field_ slider all the way down in the in-game settings _Display_ section. Then continue with my configurations.

**Cond. Expressions MCM** - Disable out of stamina, in pain,
headache/diseased expressions.

**Diziet’s Auto Outfits MCM** - In configuration settings, check the option
to unset all hotkeys for this mod.

**End Times MCM** - Lock the slider to not be tempted to change the final
date all time. I think one in-game year (approximately 18 real life
days) is good enough (and even feels right somehow), disable the spell
and countdown. You can always enter into MCM again to see how much time
you have left.

**Hide Your Quests MCM** - I recommend to hide right away all quests you get
right at the beginning except the main one, because you won’t be able to
start Helgen Reborn quest right at the beginning (read Gameplay Guide
for more information) and because The Sinister Seven quest isn’t the one
where you go to objective, just hide it, quest givers will look to you
when a time comes. Tried to understand how to make the quest with
Thalmor involved appear after you finish Diplomatic Immunity quest for
immersiveness, but couldn't, will look at that later, so let it be this
way - you heard about what is happening from elves when you were trying
to cross Skyrim’s border. You can do it as fast as you want, but enemies
won’t be the easiest ones to beat. I would recommend getting at least
level 15.

**Improved Follower Dialogue MCM** - If Lydia is too noisy, feel free to
change her comment frequency.

**Look what you see ! MCM and activation** - In the *Follow the Camera Mode*
menu choose hybrid head-tracking option and then choose *Disable when
weapon drawn* in the *Other Options*. After configuring all other mods
in MCM, press *V* key in the game to activate the mod.

**Smart NPC Potions MCM** - Standard potion drops aren’t affected, so set an
option to drop this mod’s potions to 0%. Change the chance of NPCs
having potions to 20% (we don’t want everyone to have those, right?) and
the number of potions to 3.

**SmoothCam MCM (if you have followed the *Interface* section of the
add-on)** - Activate the preset in *Presets* by pressing on *Slot 6:
Octavian’s Preset* in *Load Preset*. If you want, you can also enable
shoulder swapping in *Following* by choosing your shoulder swap key. I
recommend one of your mouse’s buttons if you have many buttons on it.
Then in *Crosshair*, enable *3D Magic Crosshair,* set minimum and
maximum crosshair size to 50, enable *Stealth Meter Offset* and an
option to always offset it, then set its Y offset to 200 (stealth meter
instructions should not be needed after the update of Smoothcam, but I
will leave them be for reference and for Y offset’s changes).

**Strange Runes MCM** - In the *Runes* section disable the *Allow NPC
Casting* option, otherwise NPCs can start behaving oddly and ward runes
look weird on them.

**TK Dodge MCM** - Change input method and forward roll input to *Double Tap
Only*, check *Step Dodge* option.

**Werewolf Widget Control MCM and instructions** - Change opacity to 60 and
text colour to white. The timer won’t work during your first
transformation, after transforming at least once, save your game. When
you transform again, it will be at the top of the screen near your
compass.

**Wyrmstooth MCM** - Change starting requirements to be the quest starting
after *A Blade in the Dark* quest is done (otherwise it feels too soon
for an organization to give this quest out).

**Animated Shouts activation** - After configuring all other mods
in MCM, press your right *Alt* key in the game to activate the
mod.

**Inigo Whistle Key’s activation** - You can issue commands to Inigo by
whistling to him. This ability is introduced during his quests and will
be explained in-game. You will need to press , button to use the
whistle in the game.

**Skyrim's Paraglider activation** - Toggle paraglider by pressing your activation key (_E_ by default), while in the air. Use your shout key (_Z_ by default) to fly higher.

**Reminder about Cured Serana Patch** - If you cure Serana from her vampirism in the future, remember to save the game, close it and then in MO2 enable the patch, which you will be able to find inside the _NPC Overhauls_ separator. Then you can safely continue the game and you will see that Serana actually looks like human now.

Now for the manual guide users I recommend you to go to [here](https://github.com/DragonBlame/tpf-dragons-edition/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to see if you didn’t miss any 
important updates.

And some hints (and possibly **spoilers**) before the end.

At first, be sure to do at least half of the main quest series as some
added quests are tied to it (more information in _Gameplay Guide_).

Secondly, look inside Helgen’s Keep’s entries thoroughly as there will
be one little reward for attentive ones.

Thirdly, for people, who would want to adopt children and live with them
not in vanilla homes, there will be a neat spell book waiting for you
somewhere around Riverwood.

And another one - be sure to travel around Falkreath. Something interesting might happen.

## ENB

I love colours and to actually see where I am going, when playing the
game.

Some time ago TPF by default used _Rudy ENB_, which details were great,
but lightning left much to be desired. Like you can see in the
screenshot, if there is no light source near, we are in some kind of a
void of darkness, which troubles us pretty much everywhere. In my
opinion, that isn’t right at all. Do you sit at home with one little
light on and don’t see anything else around you? No, so this isn’t the
right ENB for us.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37147270/130332396-e3a03b41-10cb-4075-93a3-13ec316b3301.png)

Now as default TPF uses Serio’s ENB, which allows users with low end PCs
to use much needed features of ENB and make lightning to be a bit
better, but at the cost of removing more consuming features and
sometimes making things look too yellow for my taste.

At the moment I am using Silent Horizons ENB, which actually helps very
much with the lightning issue, and makes things look crisp and full with
colours. Another positive moment is that it almost doesn’t need any kind
of adjustments for TPF weather or any other mods, so we just need to
change ENB files and add a good addition for it.

*(ft. Little Touches - A Tree Placement for Whiterun City)*

### [Silent Horizons ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21543)

**Main files** - D) Silent Horizons ENB for Cathedral Weathers

**Optional files** - Silent Horizons - Solar Cleaner

At first, delete `enbcache` folder you can find in your root folder.

Put *Silent Horizons ENB Addon - Solar Cleaner* right at the start of
the add-on’s _Landscape_ section in your mod order and put it right under
*WoW Dragon Mounds CTD Fix.esp* in your plugins’ load order. Then
Extract the main file. Open the optional folder, then depth of field
configuration folder. Choose your favourite depth of field settings with
the help of the photos you can find in the folder. I prefer the extra
light one. Open the folder of your choice, copy the folder, which is
inside, go back to the beginning and open *Silent Horizon 7.1 Cathedral
Weathers* folder, paste your chosen folder here and confirm the
override.

Open `enblocal.ini` file in the folder, change input commands to be as
the some ones as in TPF:

-   KeyCombination=0
-   KeyUseEffect=121
-   KeyFPSLimit=0
-   KeyShowFPS=118
-   KeyScreenshot=0
-   KeyEditor=122

## GAMEPLAY GUIDE

Just a little heads up and how and when and how you should start newly
added quests.

The quests, which are added to the add-on, can be split between early
and mid game and late game ones, because their difficulty slightly
differs.

#### Early and Mid Game Quests

**Winterhold Deep Sea Ruins** - Can be started any time by going northeast
from Winterhold. A journal can be found there in small ruins, which will
point you to the location with a ship marker. Should be done without a
follower.

**Clockwork** - Automatically after reaching level 5. Without a follower.

**Beyond Skyrim - Bruma** - Can be started any time in *Pale Pass* (will be
marked as two rocks together) southeast of Helgen.

**Moonpath to Elsweyr** - Can be started any time in Bruma’s *Greenwood*,
the southernmost point of County Bruma.

**Identity Crisis** - Can be started any time in *Abandoned Stables*
southeast of Yngol Barrow. Without a follower.

**Moon and Star** - Automatically after finishing the main quest *The* *Way
of the Voice.*

**Carved Bink** - After reaching level 10 in *Abandoned Grotto* west of Lost
Knife Hideout.

**Project AHO** - After reaching level 15, head to Braidwood Inn (located at
Kynesgrove) and talk to the innkeeper. Without a follower.

**Darkend** - Can be started any time in *Voyager's End* north of Ysgramor's
Tomb. At least level 15 is recommended.

**The Wheels of Lull** - Automatically after reaching level 20, can be
finished after reaching level 35.

**Helgen Reborn** - **Must** be started after 5 days after you have finished the
main quest *Unbound*. Recommended to be started at level 20. Read the
book *Helgen Reborn Guide* in your inventory to start the quest.

**The Tools of Kagrenac** - Join College of Winterhold and finish the
side questline *Arniel’s Endeavor*. You’ll also need to have finished
*The Way of the Voice*. A couple of days after you completed *Arniel’s
Endeavor* and claimed _Keening_, the quest will start automatically. Make
sure you have Keening in your inventory, it will turn into a quest item
when the mod starts.

**The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal** - After reaching level 20 and after
pickpocketing or stealing anything. Level 30-35 is recommended, for
thief characters (sneaking and pickpocketing).

#### Late Game Quests

**Undeath** - Automatically without anything happening after reaching level
30 (I know, not immersive, unfortunately the patch for making it start
in a better way was removed from Nexus, going to deal with that later,
the late game quest, considered you should have gotten it after one
Dragonborn quest).

**The Forgotten City** - Automatically after reaching level 40. The story
responds to your character’s individual history, actions, so a high
level of speech skill (approximately 60) is also recommended. Enemies
will be pretty tough, but not as tough as within other late game quests.
That’s and also the immersiveness is the reason for setting this quest
requirements as high, because by default it starts at level 5. Without a
follower.

**The Ice Blade of the Monarch** - Can be started any time in *Pilgrim's
Trench* northeast of The Tower Stone, hard mod.

**The Tournament of the Ten Bloods** - Can be started after reading *The
Story of Lyrisius* in the Arcanaeum, hard mod.

**Wyrmstooth** - automatically after Level 10 and after finishing the main
quest *A Blade in the Dark*. According to the official guide book, it
can be challenging even for level 70 characters. It is also recommended
to be prepared before venturing into the quest with some potions and
arrows if you are an archer.

**The Grand Paladin** - After reading a book *The Grand Paladin* in Bards
College or Skaal's Village Great Hall. Having more than 300 health is
highly recommended. PC must be able to shout, very hard mod.

**The Final Cataclysm** - Automatically after reaching level 50 and after
finishing the main quest *The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller*. Stealth and
combat oriented character required, very hard mod. After reaching level
60, a bonus quest becomes available.

I have tried to write as little information as I could so as not to
spoil the content. Won’t tell you any details about your potential new
followers and other surprises as they should be discovered pretty easily
while exploring.

## BUGS (not used right now)

I am sorry if you need to use this paragraph.

You have read right at the start on the Nexus page that if something bad
happens I want a normal report, not something like *nothing is working
wtf help plz*. In my opinion, it is a fair request, so, please, try your
best.

Of course, if you are reporting not an in-game bug, I am not expecting 5
sentences about that, just write what the problem is in
*#tpf-addons-support*.

Report requirements:

-   Title of the report should be made according to the problem (not
    *Issue, HELP!!!!, problem*, but something like *Black Face, Flying
    Rock* etc.);

-   Copy of YOUR *modlist.txt* and *loadorder.txt* (Navigate to your MO2
    folder, open *profiles* folder, then *The Phoenix Flavour -
    Dragon’s Edition*) (use Google Drive, text sharing service etc.);

-   Screenshot of the problem (copy and paste in the report or again
    just use a picture sharing service etc.) (when the problem is
    seeable on the screen, open the console (*\~* key) and press on
    the problem, then take screenshot);

-   Description of the problem (what, when, where);

-   Try to repeat the issue (go somewhere else, then do whatever you
    were doing before again for at least 3 times);

-   How to repeat the issue (remember that Skyrim is Skyrim, so if the
    issue can’t be repeated, I won’t be able to help) (if by your
    report it is understandable how to repeat the issue (in the
    example), of course, you don’t need to write the same thing
    again).

#### Example

***Black Face***

*A person has sent me a screenshot of a guard with black face and I
see all the data about the guard from a console, her perfect, untouched
modlist.txt and loadorder.txt.*

_Was going to Whiterun for the first time, right near the gate of the
city one of the guards has black face. Have tried to get to the stables
and then return, but the issue is still there._

I will try to respond as fast as I can. Please, be mindful that I have
studies, other hobbies and many other things to do and places to be, so
don’t directly message me for this.
