# Bug Reporting

You have read right at the beginning that if something bad happens I would like to see a normal report, not something like *nothing is working wtf help plz*. 
In my opinion, it is a fair request, so, please, try your best to follow.

Of course, if you are reporting not an in-game bug, I am not expecting 5 sentences about that, just write what the problem is in appropriate channels. 
And if another person reported any kind of issue you have too, mention that you are having the same issue.
That is important for me, because then I will know that issue is global and maybe I will need your help to resolve it. 

## Report requirements

*   Confirmation that you haven't modified or added anything to the add-on;
    
>   If something even hints some kind of addition, you will be asked for **YOUR** *modlist.txt* and *loadorder.txt* (Navigate to your MO2
    folder, open *profiles* folder, then to the profile with problem) 
    (**don't copy those directly to report as text**).

*   Version of the add-on;

>   Can be found on the first separator for WJ users.  

*   Screenshot or video of the problem if appliable;
   
>   Copy and paste in the report or just use any kind of picture/video sharing service etc. (when the problem is seeable, open the console (*\~* key) and press on the
    problem to see maybe the console gives more information on the source of the issue, then take the screenshot).

*   Description of the problem (what, when, where);

*   Try to repeat the issue (go somewhere else, then do whatever you
    were doing before again for at least 3 times);

*   How to repeat the issue.

>   Remember that Skyrim is Skyrim, so if the
    issue can’t be repeated, I won’t be able to help (if by your
    report it is understandable how to repeat the issue (in the
    example), of course, you don’t need to write the same thing
    again).

## Example of the Bug Report

A person has sent me a screenshot of a guard with black face and I
see all the data about the guard from a console, her perfect, untouched
modlist.txt and loadorder.txt.

_Was going to Whiterun for the first time, right near the gate of the
city one of the guards has black face. Have tried to get to Whiterun
and then return, but the issue is still there._

I will try to respond as fast as I can. Please, be mindful that I have
studies, other hobbies and many other things to do and places to be.
