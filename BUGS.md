# Bug Reporting

To better understand and fix problems related to the modpack I would need to get a decent report, not something like *nothing is working wtf help plz*. 
In my opinion, it is a fair request, so, please, try your best to follow these simple rules and principles of bug reporting.

At first, **don't expect support for adding any other mods or for your modified setups of the modlist**. Everyone in the community are just people, 
who have their own life and work to do. I and other users can offer resources and tips about dealing with mod conflicts in the respective channels, 
but we aren't robots to know each and every mod and its consequences on the modpack. You can believe that mods are simply compatible out of the box, 
but it isn't. That is why you are here. I understand that can be scary for beginners, but it really is how it is. You will need some effort from your side
in order to make the game more suited for yourself. So if you can add something, do it. If you can't, learn how to do it. Here are some good resources for the beginning - 
[ModdingSkyrim](https://moddingskyrim.com/), [Lively's Learn How To Wiki](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/Main.md). If you tried, 
but something is still not right, you can ask for advice in [Wabbajack Discord server](https://discord.gg/wabbajack)'s _#general-se-discussion_ or 
[TPF Discord server](https://discord.gg/tpf)'s _#tpf-de-modifications_ channel.

At second, support with in-game issues is offered in TPF Discord server's _#tpf-de-wabbajack-support_ and _#tpf-de-crash-reports_ channels and Wabbajack Discord server's _#tpf-dragons-edition-support_ channel.

At third, if another person reports any kind of issue you have too, mention that you are having the same issue.
That is important for me, because then I will know that issue is global and maybe I will need your help to resolve it. 

At fourth, if you aren't reporting an in-game bug, I am not asking you to write stories about that, just say what the problem is in appropriate channels. 

## Report requirements

*   Confirmation that you haven't modified the modpack;

*   Version of the fork;
>   Can be found on the first separator inside the mod organizer.  

*   Screenshot or video of the problem if appliable;
>   When the problem is seeable, open the console (`~` key) and press on the problem to see maybe the console gives more information on the source of the issue.
    Then copy and paste in the report or just use any kind of picture/video sharing service.

*   Description of the problem (what, when, where);

*   How to repeat the issue.    
>   Remember that Skyrim is Skyrim, so if the issue can’t be repeated at least 3 times, I won’t be able to help.

## Example of the Bug Report

A person has sent me a screenshot of a guard with black face and I
see all the data about the guard from a console.

_Was going to Whiterun for the first time, right near the gate of the
city one of the guards has a black face. Have tried to get to Whiterun
and then return 2 more times, but the issue is still there._
