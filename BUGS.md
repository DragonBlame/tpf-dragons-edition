# Bug Reporting

To better understand and fix problems related to the modpack I would need to get a decent report, not something like *nothing is working wtf help plz*. 
In my opinion, it is a fair request, so, please, try your best to follow these simple rules and principles of bug reporting.

At first, **don't expect support for adding any other mods or for your modified setups of the modlist**. Everyone in the community are just people, 
who have their own life and work to do. I and other users can offer resources and advice about dealing with mod conflicts in the respective channels, 
but do not ask about adding something or expecting that someone will deal with the problem in your place. If you can add something, do it. 
If you can't, at first learn how to do it. If you tried your best, but something is still not right, chime inside Wabbajack Discord server's _#general-se-discussion_ or 
TPF Discord server's _#tpf-de-modifications_ channel.

At second, if another person reported any kind of issue you have too, mention that you are having the same issue.
That is important for me, because then I will know that issue is global and maybe I will need your help to resolve it. 

At third, if you aren't reporting an in-game bug, I am not asking you to write stories about that, just write what the problem is in appropriate channels. 

## Report requirements

*   Confirmation that you haven't modified the add-on;
    
>   If something even hints some kind of addition, you will be asked for **YOUR** *modlist.txt* and *loadorder.txt* (Navigate to your mod organizer folder, 
    open *profiles* folder, then to the profile with problem) (don't copy those directly to report as text, load as a file).

*   Version of the add-on;

>   Can be found on the first separator in MO2.  

*   Screenshot or video of the problem if appliable;
   
>   Copy and paste in the report or just use any kind of picture/video sharing service (when the problem is seeable, open the console (`~` key) and press on the
    problem to see maybe the console gives more information on the source of the issue, then take the screenshot).

*   Description of the problem (what, when, where);

*   Try to repeat the issue (go somewhere else, then do whatever you
    were doing before again for at least 3 times);
    
>   Remember that Skyrim is Skyrim, so if the issue can’t be repeated, I won’t be able to help (if by your
    report it is understandable how to repeat the issue (in the
    example), of course, you don’t need to write the same thing
    again).

*   How to repeat the issue.

## Example of the Bug Report

A person has sent me a screenshot of a guard with black face and I
see all the data about the guard from a console, her perfect, untouched
modlist.txt and loadorder.txt.

_Was going to Whiterun for the first time, right near the gate of the
city one of the guards has black face. Have tried to get to Whiterun
and then return, but the issue is still there._

I will try to respond as fast as I can. Please, be mindful that I have
studies, other hobbies and many other things to do and places to be.
