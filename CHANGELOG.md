# Changelog

## Version 2.5.

**New safe is required.**

This big chungus brings us... many things.
From now on, thanks to the mod Seasonal Landscapes with our combination of other mods, our seasons look even more diverse and actually much more close to what I have wanted to see right at the beginning. Tried my luck to make it even better by making insects and farm plants seasonal too, but unfortunately with no luck for now. Maybe that will come later, but for now we have still many things to enjoy.


Honourable mentions are also _Better Third Person Selection_, which will make your walkthrough even more enjoyable with upgraded UI, and _Dynamic Weather and Time Based Detection_, which will surely make lives of stealthy archers more harder outdoors. 

Also your daily reminder about the preset competition, which is still happening in the TPF's Discord server. Be sure to join if you want to feature your work in the add-on and to win a 30 EUR (32 USD) worth Steam game. All the rules are pinned inside _#tpf-de-competitions_ channel.

Other variants were Lake Haven and Leaf Rest, but Lake Haven is incompatible with one of the content mods we are using, while Leaf Rest (my first candidate) is perfect, but a nightmare for consistency patching (I have tried...).

## Removed Mods

* Markarth HD Retexture
> For TPF the same changes were made for dwemer related meshes and textures if we exclude this mod (I guess that means I understand a thing or two about choosing textures).
* Patches for Ancient Dwemer Metal and new content mods
> Our usual dwemer weapons use different assets for changing their appearance, so we are fine without these. 
* The Paarthurnax Resolution
* Apachii Divine Elegance Store - UNP Meshes
> They didn't affect us anyhow negatively, because UNP is pretty close to vanilla body we are using, but there is no need for this patch now.
* Kyoe's Bang'n Brows for High Poly Head
* Seasons of Skyrim - Remove Unwanted Grass
* Shrubs of Snow
> The last two are just not needed with Seasonal Landscapes.
