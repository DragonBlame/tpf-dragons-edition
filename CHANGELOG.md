## Added Mods

* Unarmed Weapon Speed Scaling
* Relighting Skyrim
* Bandit Lines Expansion - Dark Elfs Add-On
* Lakeview Manor - As It Should Be
* Assorted Bruma Mesh Fixes
* Lucien - Creation Club - Alternative Armors - Silver Patch
* Remove Dust Fog Smoke Mist Glow
> Just removing dust for us. Like somehow Bethesda thought it will be a good idea not to make decent window shadows, but just to put dust effect in their place. Better to be without it then.
* Cathedral - 3D Snow Berries
* Cathedral Snowberries - Inventory - Wreath - Hearthfires Planter
* Magical Blackreach
* Immmersive Equipment Displays
* Alchemy Ingredients - ENB Light
> Covers uncovered ingredients, while making some of already covered ones look even better.

## Removed Mods

* e-FPS and its patches
> The culprit of LODs popping up or not appearing at all. I prefer quality of LODs more than performance, because, as a reminder, this modlist was never supposed to be the most performance friendly one.
* XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended - Fixed Scripts
> Isn't needed anymore, because of XP32 scripts being removed. 
* Relighting Skyrim with Window Shadows
> While normal shadows for windows are surely great, the mod author of Window Shadows no longer maintains it, meanwhile the author of Relightning Skyrim still does the job and pretty well.
* Relighting Skyrim - No Player Homes
* JK's Sinderion's Field Laboratory
> I have realised that even thou it looks great, it makes no sense for it to be so good in Blackreach.
* Awesome Potions Simplified - ENB Lights
> It is too much. They are pretty bright on their own.

## Changes

* Enabled patch for reducing difficulty of Dragon War.
> The patch just adjusts some values, so dragons don't have so much health anymore (which was pretty annoying as they were just bullet sponges) and their attacks deal a bit less damage, but they are still the force to be reckoned with.
* Removed everything except meshes from XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended.
> That means that there won't be any more bloat or scripts accumulating over time on your saves. 
* ESLified many of the plugins to free space for the additions.
