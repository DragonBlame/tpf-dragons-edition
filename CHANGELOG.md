### Miscellaneous

Moved some mods out to the _Gameplay Overhauls_ section. Now it will be much easier for me tinker with this section and it woudn't look so cluttered.

### Appearance

Added instructions to rename Feminine Khajiit Textures and tweaked them for Masculine Khajiit Textures not to overwrite TPF's ones.

### Animations

Fixed a mistake for Dual Sheath's INI changes, which had gotten there after the migration to GitHub.

While it isn't a major change, you should download and install the patches again, remove the older versions and apply the newest load order.

Changed scaling and layout of some images (thanks to Matt Eden).

Hid terrain LOD textures, which were overwriting A Quality World Map, so update them.

Generated output for DynDOLOD for TPF's performance guide users.
