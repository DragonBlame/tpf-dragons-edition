### Removed Mods

* Silent Horizons ENB, its patch
* Miraak - Dragonborn Follower
> Not actually needed, we are fine just with Miraak - Dragonborn Follower Dialogue Overhaul.
* Miraak Husbando
> The mod is looking bad for us, because we don't use specific skin textures, so I have decided to replace it. 
* Better Wyrmstooth Map With Roads
* Facegen Output for Random Mods
* The Sinister Seven
> I love the mod, I am fine with enemies coming whenever they come, but it should start more immersively. It is the only mod with this problem now after
Kaidan got his deserved treatment (if we exclude Undeath, which at least starts some time later and has much more content), so I have decided to remove it for consistency.
* Rayek's End
> The mod has a bunch of issues starting from people not being able to download the modpack because of it and ending with not correctly working items, 
so I removed it for now.
* Fixed Mesh Lighting - Ancient Trees of Skyrim Patch
> Included in Fixed Mesh Lightning's update.
* Diverse Skyrim - Cathedral NPCs Facegen Patch

> After looking at Tragedian's version of Lydia, I have decided to go with it.
* All AI Overhaul patches
> I generate and then manually correct these from now on.
* Literally Unplayable - Shield Sisters Re-Imagined Patch

### Changes

* Removed manual guide.
* Overhauled documentation, mainly the gameplay guide.
* Removed some of TPF's mods, which were completely overwritten by ours.
* Divided miscellaneous mods into more categories. 
* Interface changes are no longer optional.
> I believe that many people use my modifications for TPF's interface. Those, who don't, probably can change these by themselves.
* Made crosshair and Quick Loot's UI bigger.
> Should make ultrawide users' lives easier too.
* Updated for TPF's latest version, but without A Matter of Time, Nordic UI and cursor changes.
> Have tried Nordic UI hundreds of times, still don't like it. And overall I don't feel that I need to see in-game time. 
* Readded full KS Hairdos.
> Because I have gone through it again and chosen good hairstyles for men to use.
* Changed priorities of NPC overhauls.
> If we aren't talking just about removals and additions. That means that NPCs should now look more diverse.
* Made hoods and other type of headgear, which isn't armour, appear much more less on NPCs.
* Made NPCs put their shields on their backs too, while they aren't using them.
* Tweaked Honed Metal.
> Now everything should be just a little bit more expensive and time consuming to balance everything out. 
But you will wait more for common ingredients if NPCs don't have them. It didn't make sense that they got them so fast.
* Locked some previously easily obtainable houses, left riddles in the gameplay guide on how to get the keys. 
* Cleaned up Helgen Keep's entrance. 
* Fixed Xander's face.
