# Changelog

## Version 2.8.

**New save is required.**

I believe at this point I have added, removed or changed everything I have ever wanted (if we don't count an artifact overhaul I am dreaming about and probably something else I will remember about when it comes), so let's hope that modders will give everyone a little break, I will give you a break and I will be able to just chill for a while, while maintaining and polishing and actually finally enjoying the list, while streaming it from time to time to get even closer to you.

This time welcome _Ghosts of the Tribunal_, which with some other complimenting mods will add content to Solstheim, while being not as annoying thanks to its professionally reduced cut, _College of Winterhold - Quest Expansion_, which will finally make us do what we are actually supposed to do in college - learn (who would have thought) - and _EVG Animation Variance_ and its patch, which will allow to traverse dungeons in more unique ways. Also let's not forget about DeltaRider's _Oblivion - An Atronach Forge Overhaul_ and _Arachnomancy - A Spider Scrolls Overhaul_, which together overhaul ones of the most underlooked mechanics in the game, while also giving some love to vampires with _Vampire Feeding Tweaks_.

And give applause to the overhauled [feedback survey version 2.0.](https://forms.gle/2AxB1oT9vnzvdYwD7)! As some of you may not know, I love to hear from people and make necessary changes to the list if those are asked for and actually needed. I hope this time I will see much more answers too to make even better feedback report for you all. Please, fill it only after getting acquainted with the newest version of the list. After some time I will definitely remind you about it and something else too...
