# Changelog

## Version 1.14.

> Updated final patches. Updated DynDOLOD and Occlusion outputs.

### Exteriors

* Removed _The Great Cities - Minor Cities and Towns_ and each patch related to it.
> I should have done long time ago. Even thou the mod makes non-existant vanilla versions of towns look like actual towns befitting their story, it felt like a compatibility nightmare, which was following me all this time I have decided to add it. _Cities of the North_ series already do great job on helping these towns become unique and we still have _The Great Cities_ series for even smaller places unlike Falkreath and other capitals of the holds. Now I am finally in peace with this section of the add-on.
