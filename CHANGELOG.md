# Changelog

## Version 2.7.2.

**Is save compatible. Delete *enbcache* folder in your installation folder's *Stock Game* folder and unequip character and/or NPC lights from *Character Lights* mod if you have been using them.**

Even thou it is a save compatible update, I would say that it is pretty important as not only were vampires fixed, but also signifant performance boosts were achieved, while making some great QoL additions and also reworking our animations for overall preference.

A major update is somewhere not far away too and with it will come a new feedback survey and possibly something else, so stay tuned.

## Added Mods

* Creation Club Open Helmets
* Actually Useful Butter Churns
* Remove Menu Blur
* Falskaar - Addons and Patches - Fast Travel Fix
* Unblended - Really Blended Roads
* Silver Objects SMIMed
* SMIM Barrel Expansion - Mead Barrel - Oil Barrel - Butter Churn
* FK's Diverse Racial Skeletons
> Decided to switch out skeletons again to something cleaner other people use. Also this mod doesn't tend to break vampires.
* Recoil On Objects
* Conditional Armor Type Animations
* Vanargand, Leviathan and Goetia animations from Verolevi
* Draw 2 - Dual Weapon Equip-Unequip Animations
* Take a Seat - New DAR Sitting Animations

## Removed Mods

* Lucien CC patches
* Lucifer CC patches
> Considering the fact they all are related to Alternative Armors little quests, those are no use for us. Oopsies.
* Seasonal Landscapes for ENB Complex Grass
> Its' better version is now included in the main mod.
* Racial Body Morphs
* Character Light
* Relaxed Sneak Animations
* Pretty Combat Animations - Weapon Master
* New Animation for Magic Casting

* Pristine Vanilla Movement

## Changes

* Applied BethINI's medium preset and Phoenix's tweaks to our INIs.
> You will get better performance with almost no visual difference. Probably the only thing you will be able to recognize is that grass was just a little bit trimmed here and there and LODs are being a little bit odd from time to time for now as I am planning to redo those for these tweaks in the not save compatible update. I believe such a performance boost is worth a little inconsistency. Thanks for one of my users for making me check this after their impressive results.
* Tweaked our ENB preset for better performance.
> Removed some options you probably haven't even seen in action before. Thanks to Annakins for that.
* Fixed vampire black face issue.
* Moved the first person labels further away from objects they are attached to, moved the third person labels a bit closer.
> Have heard a bunch of people commenting out that they were too close in the first person, so here we go. Now they both use the same distance in the first and the third person camera.
* Disabled Improved Camera's intrusions into killmoves.
* Disabled option to be able to ride horse in the first person.
> Horse combat in general is just a mess no one wants to touch, so it is very hard to do something decent with it.

## Version 2.7.1.

**Is save compatible.**

Like always with big updates, there were also some oopsies done, which should now be fixed.

**If you are using version 2.7.**, do not recruit kitties as they will always follow you even if you dismiss them. Swiftly Order Squad will still teleport your kitty and everything else related to followers will still apply to them. Of course, if you have nothing against it, go for it. If you have already recruited them, just load the save before that and you should be safe.
Unfortunately, that is the problem within the mod I wasn't aware of, so sorry about that.
This update will remove cats' follower dialogue, but only on new saves, so take care. They will just as citizens of Skyrim (except some meanies like Nazeem) mingling around and boosting our happiness.

## Added Mods

* Kaidan and Inigo Banter Patch
* Don't Sheathe Bound Weapons - DAR Animations

## Changes

* Fixed CTD in Silent Moons Ruins.
* Made cats not to be recruitable as followers.
> As they can't be dismissed otherwise because of the mod's issue. Our kitties are pretty cute, so they can just be there and please people, while not causing any issues. Just to clear it out, I woudn't like to use Cat's life as their kitties aren't as cute as ours. This change will work only on new saves, so I will just put warnings about the problem in appropriate places.
* Added sounds to many objects.
> Footsteps, weapons' impact etc.
* Changed TK Dodge button back to `Mouse 4`.
* Resolved some lightning conflicts between SFCO patches and Luminosity and Obscure's College of Winterhold.

## Updated Mods

* Additional Clockwork

---

## Removed Mods

* e-FPS and its patches
> The culprit of LODs popping up or not appearing at all. I prefer quality of LODs more than performance, and, as a reminder, this modlist was never supposed to be the most performance friendly one.
* XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended - Fixed Scripts
> Isn't needed anymore, because of XP32's scripts being removed. 
* Relighting Skyrim with Window Shadows
> While normal shadows for windows are surely great, the mod authors of Window Shadows no longer maintain it, meanwhile the authors of Relightning Skyrim still do the job and pretty well, but on the main mod itself.
* Relighting Skyrim - No Player Homes
* Frozen in Time - Definitely Not A Snow Elf Waifu Mod
> Too much waifu and too little content. Also it conflicts with Magical Blackreach and I didn't want to deal with patching. But it definitely is unique, which I will maybe readd some time later.
* JK's Sinderion's Field Laboratory
> I have realised that even thou it looks great, it makes no sense for it to be so good in Blackreach.
* Awesome Potions Simplified - ENB Lights
> It is too much. They are pretty bright on their own.

## Changes

* Enabled patches for reducing difficulty of Dragon War. Added information about it to the Wabbajack guide.
> The patch just adjusts some values, so dragons don't have so much health anymore (which was pretty annoying as they were just bullet sponges) and their attacks deal a bit less damage, but they are still the force to be reckoned with.
* Removed everything except meshes from XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended.
> That means that together with Racemenu fix there shouldn't be any more bloat or scripts accumulating over time on your saves.
* Fixed Cicero's black face.
* Changed The Forgotten City to start at level 30.
> I guess level 40 was a bit too much.
* Bunch of fixes for little things.
* Added user made presets for the list.
* Added more general info about included mods and Anniversary Upgrade to the gameplay guide.
* ESLified many of the plugins to free space for future additions.
