Changed intructions for Rayek's End to download different version of the mod.

### ENB

Changed instructions to move Silent Horizons ENB Addon - Solar Cleaner at the start of the add-onâ€™s Landscape section in your mod order.

### Wabbajack

Added information and actually capped the game at 75 FPS, as the bigger number can lead to different oddities in Skyrim's physics. Also have made it borderless (it has been already done before, but wasn't documented).

Added information about the mods, which were disabled in both of my add-on's profiles (it has been already done before, but wasn't documented). Actually disabled some of the mods, which weren't disabled, in the performance profile of the add-on.

Removed from the description about disabled TPF's mods information about Free Look as it was removed from TPF.

Added _Cured Serana Patch_, which I forgot to do before. Added reminder about the patch in the _Configurations_ section of the documentation mainly for Wabbajack users. 

Added instructions to remove Silent Horizons ENB Addon - Solar Cleaner if you aren't using Silent Horizons ENB. Moved it to our _Landscape_ separator, not to be inside TPF's separators.

Fixed TPF Dragon's Edition - Terrain LOD, TPF Dragon's Edition - DynDOLOD Output (and performance output) and TPF Dragon's Edition - Occlusion by removing Bruma's Terrain LOD, which wasn't supposed to be there in the first place (oops). And, of course, DynDOLOD and occlusion needed to be remade for new additions.
