# Changelog

## Version 2.6.1.

**Is save compatible.**

Approximately 80% of people, who have filled in my little survey in the TPF Discord's server, don't like Culminated ENB, so while I was up for the task I have decided to make the experience of playing the game for you better by switching to PI-CHO ENB, which many people enjoy for its similarities with Silent Horizons ENB, while being more crisp and fresh. With some tweaks to saturation and some other litttle things here and there I have started to grow up on it and couldn't switch it to anything else. 

And, of course, some updates and fixes as always. Can't imagine how anyone hasn't seen juniper berries already. 

## Added Mods

* PI-CHO ENB
> With little tweaks by yours truly.

## Removed Mods

* Culminated ENB

## Changes

* Fixed infinite loading screen after entering Dead Man's Drink.
* Fixed unresponsiveness after being staggered while using wards.

## Updated Mods

* Kaidan 2 Extended Edition
* Lucifer - Wyrmstooth Patch
* Seasonal Landscapes
* Dragon War - A Dragon Overhaul
* Soaking Wet - Character Wetness Effect
* Jumping Attack

## Version 2.6.

**New save is required.**

New challenger of not giving stable modding experience to its users appeared. VectorPlexus is a place, which is usually associated with High Poly Head (but is about much more... *wink...* but not just about *that*). Unfortunately, due to it being unstable many people just can't install the list and that's why I needed to make a decision to remove all the mods from VectorPlexus at least for now. Fortunately, High Poly Head is also hosted by its author on Google Drive... Armored pants won't be forgotten.

At least that has allowed me to make a not save compatible update, so here we ago. For those, who are able to resist the urge of updating their list every time, the scripting optimization mods will surely make it more pleasant to play the game for a long time. Also be ready that now you will be able to conquest some of the key locations of Skyrim for your faction of choice to control with _Lawbringer_. This update is also very beneficial for followers as now you will be able to be more close to them during your adventures by using _I'm Glad You're Here_, while also being able to give them a regular place to stay in with _Live Here_.

And the most important and life changing experience - KITTIES. They purr!

## Added Mods

* Vanilla Script (micro)Optimizations
* Vanilla Scripting Enhancements
* Fixed and Optimized USSEP Valdr Quest
* Lawbringer
* Imperial Law - Lawbringer for Bruma
* Beyond Skyrim in Skyrim - An Integration Mod
* Wyrm Tamer - Lawbringer for Wyrmstooth
* Twenty Eight Friendly Cats
* Riften Gate Restored
* JK's Sinderion's Field Laboratory
* Live Here
* I'm Glad You're Here
* Vigilance the Husky
* Draugr Ragdoll Bug Fix
* Supreme Vampire Lords
* Vampire Lord Body Reworked

## Removed Mods

* Seasonal Alchemy
> I like how Seasonal Landscapes handles plants (exception is 3D Mountain Flowers, but that is a talk for another time).
* Heavy Armored Pants
* SavrenX Vampire Lord Tank
> RIP... I will add them back immedialely if Vectorplexus is going to be in a working condition in the future.

## Changes

* Added very important rule related to Live Here.
* Changed the time allocated to finish the main quest to 14 real time days.
* Added information about Lawbringer and I'm Glad You Are Here to the gameplay guide.
* Configured the newest Equipment Toggle to work just on us and not to touch shields.
> Like it was before the previous update. You can just not equip helmet on your follower if you would like to see their face as they aren't as dependant on equipment as you. I am fine with that. And that funcionality of followers hiding their gear too conflicts with some of the followers (Dagri'hon and some others).
