# Changelog

## Version 2.1.

* Changed installation instructions for _moreHUD Inventory Edition_.

### Improved Vanilla Content

* Removed _Serana Dialogue Edit_ and its patch for _Serana Dialogue Add-on_.

### New Content

* Removed _Pandorable's Kaidan_. Added _High Poly Kaidan - Face and Body_.
> He just looks more sexy with this one.

### Exteriors

* Removed _Treerific_.
> That is sad, but it has too many problems which need to be dealth with in order to be added back. Well, at least the modlist will have less performance impact on your machines.

* Changed installation instructions for _Little Touches - A Tree Placement for Whiterun City_.
> No big trees means that they can return to the city.
