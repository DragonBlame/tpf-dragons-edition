# Changelog

## Version 1.11.1.

> Updated final patches, no outputs were changed.
> Previous changelogs can be found in the releases.

### Appearance

* Changed installation instructions for _KS Hairdos_.

---

### Other Changes

* Made lockpicking much more harder for early game.
> For example, if you are a novice at lockpicking and you try to pick a novice lock, you will have only 40% chance to break a lockpick. That's the easiest lock you can pick, so that is pretty fair for both balance and roleplay. But if you as total rookie will try to pick a master lock, be prepared to lose 15 lockpicks. Sounds reasonable for me, maybe you should lose even more. Feedback is appreciated as always. And that also works in other way - if you are a master thief (your lockpicking skill is big enough), you will get only 40% chance to break a lockpick on almost any chest.
* Made the books related to _EasierRider's Dungeon Pack_ readable.
> Thanks for Guitarninja for giving me an informatio about this and the next issue to me.
* Removed the wall of darkness in the Castle Dour's region, which is involving _Undeath_ mod.

### Wabbajack

* Enabled one of the patches for NPC overhauls back again.
> Which I have accidentally disabled somehow. Black face issues around Winterhold should be resolved.
* Added information about add-on's size.

### Updated Add-on's Mods for Wabbajack Users
