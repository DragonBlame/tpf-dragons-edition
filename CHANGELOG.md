## Added Mods

* Racemenu Memory Leak Patch
* Lakeview Manor - As It Should Be
* Assorted Bruma Mesh Fixes
* Relighting Skyrim
* Remove Dust Fog Smoke Mist Glow
> Just removing dust for us. Like somehow Bethesda thought it will be a good idea not to make decent window shadows, but just to put dust effect in their place. Better to be without it then.
* Cathedral - 3D Snow Berries
* Cathedral Snowberries - Inventory - Wreath - Hearthfires Planter
* Alchemy Ingredients - ENB Light
> Covers uncovered ingredients, while making some of them look even better.

## Removed Mods

* e-FPS and its patches
> The culprit of LODs popping up or not appearing at all. I prefer quality of LODs more than performance, because, as a reminder, this modlist was never supposed to be the most performance friendly one. 
* Relighting Skyrim with Window Shadows
> While normal shadows for windows are surely great, the mod author of Window Shadows no longer maintains it, meanwhile the author of Relightning Skyrim still does the job and pretty well.
* Relighting Skyrim - No Player Homes
* Awesome Potions Simplified - ENB Lights
> It was too much. They are pretty bright on their own.
