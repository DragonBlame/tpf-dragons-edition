## Removed Mods

* e-FPS and its patches
> The culprit of LODs popping up or not appearing at all. I prefer quality of LODs more than performance, because, as a reminder, this modlist was never supposed to be the most performance friendly one.
* XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended - Fixed Scripts
> Isn't needed anymore, because of XP32 scripts being removed. 
* Relighting Skyrim with Window Shadows
> While normal shadows for windows are surely great, the mod authors of Window Shadows no longer maintain it, meanwhile the authors of Relightning Skyrim still do the job and pretty well, but on the main mod itself.
* Relighting Skyrim - No Player Homes
* Frozen in Time - Definitely Not A Snow Elf Waifu Mod
* JK's Sinderion's Field Laboratory
> I have realised that even thou it looks great, it makes no sense for it to be so good in Blackreach.
* Awesome Potions Simplified - ENB Lights
> It is too much. They are pretty bright on their own.

## Changes

* Enabled patch for reducing difficulty of Dragon War.
> The patch just adjusts some values, so dragons don't have so much health anymore (which was pretty annoying as they were just bullet sponges) and their attacks deal a bit less damage, but they are still the force to be reckoned with.
* Removed everything except meshes from XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended.
> That means that together with Racemenu fix there shouldn't be any more bloat or scripts accumulating over time on your saves.
* Fixed Cicero's black face.
* Added user made presets for the list.
* ESLified many of the plugins to free space for future additions.
