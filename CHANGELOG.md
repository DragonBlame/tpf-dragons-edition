# Changelog

## Version 1.9.2.

> Who would have known - another ENB update. And the last one for some time. Updated final patches, outputs are the same.

### Interface

* Removed _Centaur Font_ and _Consolas Font - Centaur Font - 12th Century Book Font Patch_. Added _Font Overhaul - Natural Typefaces for Skyrim_ and _Consolas Font - Font Overhaul - 12th Century Book Font Patch_.

> I thought about the change to the main font of the add-on for a while after people had told me it is a bit too tiny. I love Centaur font for its sophistication, 
but for real and long gameplay we need something else, something more easier to read, but at the same time not too bland or cartoonish, so here we are. A bonus of getting different fonts in journals and notes from the new mod is very appreciated as well.

## NPC Overhauls

* Removed _Hood Plus Hair for Pandorable's Serana_. Added _Hood Plus Hair for Refined Volkihars Serana_.

> I guess this type of cheat worked a long time ago, when both Pandorable's Serana and Refined Volkihars' Serana shared the same hair. Fortunately for us, the quality of life change was released for Refined Volkihars too.

### Other Changes

* Fixed the issue of each sword, which has used Nightingale Blade's model, to be invisible by deleting _Frankly HD Nightingale LeanWolfs Better-Shaped Weapons and Dual Sheath Redux Patch_.

### Wabbajack

* ENBSeries binaries are now hosted on Wabbajack's server, so they won't stop setting up the modpack if Boris makes an update.

### Updated Add-on's Mods for Wabbajack Users

* ENB

## Version 1.9.1.

> Aka ENB update. Patches and outputs are the same.

### Interface

* Removed additional instructions for _Simple Activate_.

### Exteriors

* Updated installation instructions for _Cities of the North - Dawnstar_.

### Miscellaneous

* Updated installation instructions for _Player Spell Lighting_.

### Configurations

* Added reminder to setup _Simple Activate_. Changed instructions on setting it up.

> It is done like that, because now INI appears only after running the game at least once. Also there were some leftovers from instructions I have tried before.

---

### Wabbajack

* Changed default key binding for _TK Dodge RE_.

> Now it is _Mouse 3_ button by default, which in other games (and even Syrim's mods) is always _Mouse 4_ (Skyrim's oddities, I guess).

* Added an information about how to deal with ENB's updates while I haven't updated the modpack to the _Questions & Answers_ section of the main page.

### Other Changes

* Hosting the banner of the add-on on Github now instead of Google Drive.

> People shoudn't experience it not appearing anymore. Don't even know why I didn't do that at first place.

* Overhauled the documentation of the add-on a little bit.

* Overhauled the _Bugs_ section of the add-on, made changes for it everywhere.

> Now it is more as an additional guide for people to write a report about an in-game problem, which has to be used to make things easier for both me and an user. I had added it earlier than the official update came, because the changes were made for the main page too. 

* Removed TK Dodge MCM instructions as they aren't needed anymore.

* Fixed CTD, which happened near _Winterhold Deep Sea Ruins'_ area.

* Fixed some back-end records of some mods for better compatibility.

### Wabbajack

* Removed some copies of mods, which were used for TPF profiles (for instance, _NARC_, _Lanterns of Skyrim II_ etc.).

> After the removal of TPF profiles, they generally aren't needed anymore. Exclusion was made for some mods like Enhanced Blood Textures, Feminine Khajiit Textures etc., because their content is totally different from what we use now and just to make my work easier if I decide to change something.

* Changed brightness settings for ENB to be a bit darker in interiors and a bit brighter at nights in exteriors.
