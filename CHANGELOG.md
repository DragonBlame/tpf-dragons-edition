# Changelog

## Version 2.4.3.

**Is save compatible.**

It is another time to for some quality of life fixes and changes. Version 2.5. will come too (not sure when thou).

## Added Mods

* Chapter II - Jeremy Soule Inspired Music
* Vanargand Animations - Crossbows
* Pristine Vanilla Movement

## Removed Mods

* Leviathan Animations - Two-Handed High Stance
* Leviathan Animations - Two-Handed Power Attacks
> Many of Verolevi's animations have one very big issue - they always have problems with other animations, which they don't even touch, even vanilla ones. For example, blocking and block bashing with two-handed weapon looks just awkward, meanwhile power attacks assume we are using the two-handed high stance mod from Verelovevi, but if we don't, then weapons' behaviour is very odd during finishing animations. Not sure what is the point of making separate pages for them then if they are meant to be used together. Sneaking animation for crossbows, which weren't added to the list, makes you stuck in crossbow holding animation even if you have nothing inside your hands. At least regular crossbow animations look fine. 
* Jog, Sprint and Jump

## Changes

* Removed headbobbing feature from activation through mouse wheel.
* Fixed elves T-posing in Kaidan's camp.
* Removed tween menu from widescreen fixes for SkyUI to make custom skills option appear for widescreen users.

* Added and corrected information in the gameplay guide.

## Version 2.4.2.

**Is save compatible.**

From now on I will try to make save compatible updates for users, who have been using the previous version of the modpack if there is something worth fixing. Should have thought about that before, sorry. After save compatible update, not save compatible update might be released for new users if there is something, which I want to add or remove. Already can say that it won't happen for now - pines and new LODs can wait. All versions of the modpack will also be available on GitHub from this moment, so you don't have to worry if you weren't able to grab your needed version.

This time we are fixing some of the issues, which were reported by users, while also updating some mods and adding more useful information to the WJ instructions and the gameplay guide.

## Added Mods

* Elemental Staffs - Mysticism Patch
* NPCs Wear Amulets of Mara

## Changes

* Fixed the game being stuck when you take any kind of note.
* Fixed purplish winds issue.
* Fixed Bruma's black faces issue.
* Made the item widget a bit bigger, actually enabled filters to make the widget dissapear for items, which you can steal, if you are not crouched.
* Made khajiits have a bit more fur on their upper side.
* Added information about Anniversary Upgrade.
* Added information about Improved Camera.
* Added information about how to change your FOV.

## Updated Mods

* Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches
* Better Third Person Selection

## Version 2.4.1.

Just a little hotfix for Dynamic Weather and Time Based Detection to work properly.

## Changes

* Added Slidikins' fix for Dynamic Weather and Time Based Detection.

---

## Version 2.4.

**New safe is required.**

The update brings us not only to the Delta's fierce (but not as overpowered) dragons back and long awaited (and actually existing) Mysticism 2 from TPF,
but much, much more - a bunch of Apothecary patches! Joke, not just that...
From now on this fork will support only the paid version of the newest Skyrim version. 
Sooner or later you will be excpected to have them too, so I have decided that it is better to just do that now than later especially considering the fact that we rely
on content and that I would just like to include, in my opinion, some of the best creations and the ones, which don't conflict with other content (unfortunately, that means no Divine Crusader with Tate's Knight of the North). If you believe there is another hidden gem behind the remaining CC content, feel free to share in the corresponding channels of feedback.

Honourable mentions are also _Better Third Person Selection_, which will make your walkthrough even more enjoyable with upgraded UI, and _Dynamic Weather and Time Based Detection_, which will surely make lives of stealthy archers more harder outdoors. 

Also your daily reminder about the preset competition, which is still happening in the TPF's Discord server. Be sure to join if you want to feature your work in the add-on and to win a 30 EUR (32 USD) worth Steam game. All the rules are pinned inside _#tpf-de-competitions_ channel.
