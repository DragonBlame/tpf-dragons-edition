# Changelog

## Version 1.11.

> Updated final patches, all outputs.

### Interface

* Removed _Pastel SkyUI Markers_.
> Unfortunately together with TPF's _CoMAP_, they don't make the greatest combo without a patch to make CoMAP markers use pastel colours too. I let people decide, what they would want to see, and the decision was made.

### Exteriors

* Added _Happy Little Trees_.
* Added _Cities of the North - Falkreath_ and _Cities of the North - Falkreath Patch Collection_.
* Added _Bent Pines_.

### Miscellaneous

* Changed installation instructions for _Strange Runes_.

### Skeleton & Animations

* Added _Vanargand Animations - One Handed Normal Attacks_.

### NPC Overhauls

* Changed installation and added FOMOD instructions for _The Ordinary Women_.

### Literally Unplayable

* Removed _Literally Unplayable - Ordinary Women Patch_.
> As the latest _The Ordinary Women_ update resolved the head parts issue.

---

### Other Changes

* Removed the performance profile and the performance output of DynDOLOD.
> This change probably won't be the most appealing one for everyone. I have tried to maintain the performance part as much as I can, but 
overall I have spent too much of time and resources on that (outputs). I have never thought of my add-on as the performance friendly one, 
so there isn't even a point in maintaining the performance changes for me, especially considering the fact that many people, who struggle with performance already, use just TPF or something even lighter. And especially considering the exterior changes my add-on makes, which maybe or maybe not will become even bigger in the future. Of course, 
you can make the changes to performance and DynDOLOD by yourself if you want and know how to, but don't ask for advice on these ones in support channels.
* Removed some of MCMs to change.
> Because all removed ones are automated, no need to worry about them anymore.

### Wabbajack

* Removed the performance grass mods. Made changes in the Wabbajack's document related to the removal of the performance options.
> As those were used in the performance profile only.

### Updated Add-on's Mods for Wabbajack Users

* Apothecary - Bruma Patch
* Forceful Tongue - Wyrmstooth Patch
* Apothecary - Wyrmstooth Patch
* JK's The Winking Skeever
* Strange Runes
