## Version 1.10.

> Updated final patches and all outputs.

> As it was added to TPF.

### New Content

* Moved _Talkative Dragons_, _Talkative Dragons - Audio Replacer_ and _BA Bard Songs_ to the _Miscellaneous_ section of the add-on.
* Removed the section completely.
> And as the music was added back again to TPF, I don't need to worry about that anymore. 
Conflicts with our quest mods were resolved in the final patches. Considering a fact that not all people liked the overhauled shouting voices, the vanilla ones aren't exactly bad and me not wanting to keep this section for just 5 mods, I have decided to remove them.

* Changed installation instructions for _TK Dodge RE_.

### ENB

* Changed configurations for interiors' brightness.

---

### Other Changes

* Removed MCM instructions for _Strange Runes_.
> One of the latest updates finally addressed issues with the mod and NPCs, so we don't need to deactivate runes for NPCs anymore.

> Those are just a little bit more brighter now, which is still darker than default values.

* Wyrmstooth
* Dragon War - Wyrmstooth Patch
