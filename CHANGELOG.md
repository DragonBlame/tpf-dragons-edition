# Changelog

## Version 1.11.

> Updated final patches, all outputs.
> Previous changelogs can be found in the releases.

### Interface

* Removed _Pastel SkyUI Markers_.
> Unfortunately together with TPF's _CoMAP_, they don't make the greatest combo without a patch to make CoMAP markers use pastel colours too. I let people decide, what they would want to see, and the decision was made.
* Added _Oxygen Meter_.
* Changed FOMOD instructions for _SmoothCam_.
* Changed installation instructions for _No Lockpick Activate_.

### New Content

* Removed _Bruma Ugly Love Script Fix_.
> Not needed anymore with the latest updates of _Beyond Skyrim - Bruma_.
* Added _Wyrmstooth - Settings Loader_.
* Changed installation instructions for _Gladys the Corgi - A Custom Dog Follower Mod_.

### Exteriors

* Added _Happy Little Trees_.
* Added _Cities of the North - Falkreath_ and _Cities of the North - Falkreath Patch Collection_.
* Added _Bent Pines_.
* Changed installation instructions for _Cities of the North - Winterhold Patch Collection_, _The Great Town of Karthwasten Patch Collection_, _The Great Town of Ivarstead Patch Collection_, _The Great Village of Old Hroldan Patch Collection_, _The Great Town of Shor's Stone Patch Collection_, _The Great Village of Mixwater Mill Patch Collection_ and _The Great Village of Kynesgrove Patch Collection_.
> _The newest version of Lanterns of Skyrim II doesn't mess up with patches not be used with earlier version of the mod, so the newest patches for these mods can be safely used._
* Changed mod and load order for some mods.

### Interiors

* Added _JK's Temple of Talos._
* Changed FOMOD instructions for _JK's Interiors Patch Collection_.

### Appearance

* Removed _KS Hairdos Lite_.
* Added _KS Hairdos_ and _Immersive KS Hairdos_.
> I felt that _KS Hairdos Lite_ gave us a little bit too less choice on which hairstyle to pick. _KS Hairdos_ is too massive for us, so
there comes _Immersive KS Hairdos_ deleting all the anime etc. haircuts and even sorting the mod's hair by their size.

### Gameplay Overhauls

* Changed installation instructions for _Reading Is Good_.

### Miscellaneous

* Removed _ENB Lights For Effect Shaders_ and _Player Spell and Weapon Lighting_.
> As those were added to TPF.
* Added _Storm Lightning - Settings Loader_.
* Changed installation instructions for _Simply Knock SKSE64 DLL_.
* Changed installation instructions for _Strange Runes_.

### Skeleton & Animations

* Added _Vanargand Animations - One Handed Normal Attacks_.

### NPC Overhauls

* Changed installation and added FOMOD instructions for _The Ordinary Women_.

### Literally Unplayable

* Removed _Literally Unplayable - Ordinary Women Patch_.
> As the latest _The Ordinary Women_ update resolved the head parts issue.

### Preparations

* Added instructions to get back _Relightning Skyrim_.
> I want to stay with it for a while.

### Configurations

* Overhauled.
* Removed some of MCMs to change.
> Because all removed ones are automated, no need to worry about them anymore.
* Moved much of the information to _Gameplay Guide_.
* Removed information for Wabbajack users.
> As their _Wabbajack_ page also got overhauled.

### Gameplay Guide

* Overhauled.
* Added information here from _Configurations_.

### Other Changes

* Removed the performance profile and the performance output of DynDOLOD.
> This change probably won't be the most appealing one for everyone. I have tried to maintain the performance part as much as I can, but 
overall I have spent too much of time and resources on that (outputs). I have never thought of my add-on as the most performance friendly one 
(even though without its performance profile it is still easier on performance than Elysium and similar lists, so it is still an option for not as top-tier PCs), 
so I was a bit annoyed by keeping it up for every single time, especially considering the fact that many people, who struggle with performance already on TPF, use just TPF's performance profile or something even lighter. And especially considering the exterior changes my add-on makes, which maybe or maybe not will become even bigger in the future. Of course, 
you can make the changes to performance and DynDOLOD by yourself if you want and know how to, but don't ask for advice on these ones in channels related to add-ons.
* Changed some pictures in the documentation to be up to date with the add-on.
* Many other tweaks here and there.

### Wabbajack

* Changed the add-on's files to be compatible with Anniversary Edition (without CC content).
> At least for now. The only mod I maybe care about is Saints & Seducers (as it is a quest mod), I will look at it and if its compatible with the content we already have. You don't need to delete anything CC related.
* Overhauled _Wabbajack_ page.
> From now on Wabbajack users will usually need just Wabbajack page to finish setting up the add-on.
* Added mods' outputs to final patches, so manual guide users can also benefit from them.
* Removed the performance grass mods. Made changes in the Wabbajack's document related to the removal of the performance options.
> As those were used in the performance profile only.
* Moved walls and landscape around Morskom. 
> Thanks again to Sovn for the patch. There will be a little defect seen near the palace on the ground, but that should be the only one.
