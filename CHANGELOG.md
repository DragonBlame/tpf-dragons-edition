# Changelog

## Version 1.11.

> Updated final patches, Texgen and DynDOLOD outputs.

### Interface

* Removed _Pastel SkyUI Markers_.
> Unfortunately together with TPF's _CoMAP_, they don't make the greatest combo without a patch to make CoMAP markers use pastel colours too. I let people decide, what they would want to see, and the decision was made.

### Miscellaneous

* Changed installation instructions for _Strange Runes_.

### NPC Overhauls

* Changed installation and added FOMOD instructions for _The Ordinary Women_.

### Literally Unplayable

* Removed _Literally Unplayable - Ordinary Women Patch_.
> As the latest _The Ordinary Women_ update resolved the head parts issue.

---

### Other Changes

* Removed some of MCMs to change.
> Because all removed ones are automated, no need to worry about them anymore.
