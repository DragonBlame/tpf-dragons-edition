### Other Changes

* Made lockpicking much more harder for early game.
< For example, if you are a novice at lockpicking and you try to pick a novice lock, you will have only 40% chance to break a lockpick. That's the easiest lock you can pick, so that is pretty fair. But if you as total rookie will try to pick a master lock, be prepared to lose 15 lockpicks. Sounds pretty fair for me, maybe you should lose even more. Feedback is appreciated as always. And that also works in other way - if you are a master thief, you will get only 40% chance to break a lockpick on almost any chest.

### Wabbajack

* Enabled one of the patches for NPC overhauls back again.
> Which I have accidentally disabled somehow. Black face issues around Winterhold should be resolved.
