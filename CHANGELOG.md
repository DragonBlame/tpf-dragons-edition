# Changelog

## Version 2.5.

**New safe is required.**

The update brings us not only to the Delta's fierce (but not as overpowered) dragons back and long awaited (and actually existing) Mysticism 2 from TPF,
but much, much more - a bunch of Apothecary patches! Joke, not just that...
From now on this fork will support only the paid version of the newest Skyrim version. 
Sooner or later you will be excpected to have them too, so I have decided that it is better to just do that now than later especially considering the fact that we rely
on content and that I would just like to include, in my opinion, some of the best creations and the ones, which don't conflict with other content (unfortunately, that means no Divine Crusader with Tate's Knight of the North). If you believe there is another hidden gem behind the remaining CC content, feel free to share in the corresponding channels of feedback.

Honourable mentions are also _Better Third Person Selection_, which will make your walkthrough even more enjoyable with upgraded UI, and _Dynamic Weather and Time Based Detection_, which will surely make lives of stealthy archers more harder outdoors. 

Also your daily reminder about the preset competition, which is still happening in the TPF's Discord server. Be sure to join if you want to feature your work in the add-on and to win a 30 EUR (32 USD) worth Steam game. All the rules are pinned inside _#tpf-de-competitions_ channel.

## Removed Mods

* Markarth HD Retexture
> TPF actually made the same changes as me for dwemer related meshes and textures if we exclude this mod (I guess that means I understand a thing or two about choosing textures).
* Patches for Ancient Dwemer Metal and new content mods
> Our usual dwemer weapons use different assets than these, so we are fine without these. 
* The Paarthurnax Resolution
* Apachii Divine Elegance Store - UNP Meshes
> They didn't affect us anyhow negatively, because UNP is pretty close to vanilla body we are using, but there is no need for this patch actually.
* Kyoe's Bang'n Brows for High Poly Head
* Seasons of Skyrim - Remove Unwanted Grass
* Shrubs of Snow
> The last two are just not needed with Seasonal Landscapes.
