### Appearance

* Removed _Immersive KS Hairdos_.
* Added _Vanilla Hair Replacer_.
* Added _Another KS Hairdos Replacer_.
* Changed installation instructions for _KS Hairdos_.
> And now this section can be considered as perfect. Before I didn't like the fact that there were still so many hairstyles and that many of them were clipping for too much or just didn't belong to Skyrim at all. That is changed as I have made my own replacers for KS Hairdos and KS Hairdos HDT SMP plugins. We use _KS Hairdos_ only for women now as I wasn't exactly a fan of male haircuts from there. That is where _Vanilla Hair Replacer_ comes to our help, while adding some extra options for females.

> Because it was added to TPF.
* Added _Face Discoloration Fix_.
> Helps us to easily use _Vanilla Hair Replacer_.

### Preparations

* Added information about _Frozen Electrocuted Combustion_'s inclusion to TPF and its' removal from the add-on.
* Changed installation and FOMOD instructions for _Enhanced Blood Textures_.

### Configurations

* Removed MCM instructions for _Storm Lightning_.
> Now are automated.

### Other Changes

* Made lockpicking much more harder for early game.
> For example, if you are a novice at lockpicking and you try to pick a novice lock, you will have only 40% chance to break a lockpick. That's the easiest lock you can pick, so that is pretty fair for both balance and roleplay. But if you as total rookie will try to pick a master lock, be prepared to lose 15 lockpicks. Sounds reasonable for me, maybe you should lose even more. Feedback is appreciated as always. And that also works in other way - if you are a master thief (your lockpicking skill is big enough), you will get only 40% chance to break a lockpick on almost any chest.
* Removed a lock out in the main quest of the Thieves Guild, which can happen if you choose specific reply to Brynjolf connected to _Thieves Guild for Good Guys_.
> Thanks again for Guitarninja for giving me an information about this and the other two issues.
* Changed the books related to _EasierRider's Dungeon Pack_ to be readable.
* Removed the wall of darkness in the Castle Dour's region, which is involving _Undeath_ mod.
* Got rid of my plans for the add-on inside the main page.
> Overall it just felt not needed. I usually tell people about my plans.
* Adjusted some information.

### Wabbajack

* Added one of the patches for NPC overhauls back again.
> Which I have accidentally overwritten with another one somehow. Black face issues around Winterhold should be resolved.
* Made the game borderless again.
> Forgot to change those back after _SSE Display Tweaks_ update.
* Removed some of the mods, which were just disabled all the time.
> This change also made the Wabbajack document smaller.
* Added information about add-on's size.
