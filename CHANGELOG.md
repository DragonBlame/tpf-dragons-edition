# Changelog

## Version 1.10.

> Updated final patches and all outputs.

### Interface

* Removed _Alternate Conversation Camera Plus_.
> As it was added to TPF. We are also using TPF's default settings for the mod, because many people have actually said that they don't like mine. 

### New Content

* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Additional Clockwork_.

### Interiors

* Added _JK's Temple of Kynareth_.
* Changed FOMOD instructions for _JK's Interiors Patch Collection_.

### Appearance

* Changed installation and FOMOD instructions for _Masculine Argonian Textures_.

### Gameplay Overhauls

* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul_.

### Miscellaneous

* Changed installation instructions for _powerofthree's Papyrus Extender_.
* Changed the name for _Player Spell and Weapon Lighting_.
* Changed installation instructions for _Strange Runes_.
* Moved _Talkative Dragons_, _Talkative Dragons - Audio Replacer_ and _BA Bard Songs_ here from the the _Music & Sound FX_ section of the add-on.

### Music & Sound FX

* Removed _Nordic Shouts - Enigma Series_, _Better Sounding Female Dragon Shouts_, _TPF Dragon's Edition - Music Patch_ and all music mods.
* Moved _Talkative Dragons_, _Talkative Dragons - Audio Replacer_ and _BA Bard Songs_ to the _Miscellaneous_ section of the add-on.
* Removed the section completely.
> And as the music was added back again to TPF, I don't need to worry about that anymore. 
Conflicts with the quest mods were resolved in my conflict resolution patches. Considering a fact that not all people liked the overhauled shouting voices, the vanilla ones aren't exactly bad and me not wanting to keep this section for just those two mods, I have decided to remove them.

### Skeleton & Animations

* Changed installation instructions for _TK Dodge RE_.

### ENB

* Changed configurations for interiors' brightness.

---

### Other Changes

* Removed MCM instructions for _Strange Runes_.
> One of the latest updates finally addressed issues with the mod and NPCs, so we don't need to deactivate runes for NPCs anymore.

### Wabbajack

* Changed the instructions for Wabbajack users, which were related to the optional mods.
> As the _Music & Sound FX_ section was removed, there is only the _Interface_ section left.
* Removed unpacked scripts.
* Changed brightness in interiors.
> Those are just a little bit more brighter now, which is still darker than default values.

### Updated Add-on's Mods for Wabbajack Users

* Serana Dialogue Add-On
* Additional Clockwork
* Wyrmstooth
* Dragon War - Wyrmstooth Patch
* Merlin the Corgi - A Magical Dog Follower Mod
> There was actually a fast travel CTD issue related to this mod, which is fixed in this update, so maybe that was also related to issues like getting CTD after death some players were having.
* JK's The Bannered Mare
* JK's Sadris Used Wares
* JK's Interiors Patch Collection
* Masculine Argonian Textures
* Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul
* C.O.I.N. - Coins of Interesting Natures
