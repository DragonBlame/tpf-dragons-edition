# Changelog

## Version 1.11.1.

> Updated final patches, no outputs were changed.
> Previous changelogs can be found in the releases.

### Appearance

* Removed _Immersive KS Hairdos_.
* Added _Vanilla Hair Replacer_.
* Added _Another KS Hairdos Replacer_.
* Changed installation instructions for _KS Hairdos_.
> And now this section can be considered as perfect. Before I didn't like the fact that there were still so many hairstyles and that many of them were clipping for too much or just didn't belong to Skyrim at all. That is changed as I have made my own replacer for KS Hairdos plugin. We use _KS Hairdos_ only for women now as I wasn't exactly a fan of male haircuts from there. That is where _Vanilla Hair Replacer_ comes to our help, while adding some extra options for females.

### Miscellaneous

* Removed _powerofthree's Papyrus Extender_.
> Because it was added to TPF.

---

### Other Changes

* Made lockpicking much more harder for early game.
> For example, if you are a novice at lockpicking and you try to pick a novice lock, you will have only 40% chance to break a lockpick. That's the easiest lock you can pick, so that is pretty fair for both balance and roleplay. But if you as total rookie will try to pick a master lock, be prepared to lose 15 lockpicks. Sounds reasonable for me, maybe you should lose even more. Feedback is appreciated as always. And that also works in other way - if you are a master thief (your lockpicking skill is big enough), you will get only 40% chance to break a lockpick on almost any chest.
* Removed a lock out in the main quest of the Thieves Guild, which can happen if you choose specific reply to Brynjolf connected to _Thieves Guild for Good Guys_.
> Thanks again for Guitarninja for giving me an information about this and the other two issues.
* Changed the books related to _EasierRider's Dungeon Pack_ to be readable.
* Removed the wall of darkness in the Castle Dour's region, which is involving _Undeath_ mod.

### Wabbajack

* Enabled one of the patches for NPC overhauls back again.
> Which I have accidentally disabled somehow. Black face issues around Winterhold should be resolved.
* Added information about add-on's size.

### Updated Add-on's Mods for Wabbajack Users
