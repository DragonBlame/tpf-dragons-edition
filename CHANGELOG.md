* Fixed some back-end things noone has even experienced (and won't, I hope).

* Fixed CTD in Winterhold.

### Wabbajack

* Removed some of copies of mods for TPF (for instance, NARC, Lanterns of Skyrim II etc.), because after removing TPF profiles, they generally aren't needed anymore. Exclusion was made for some mods like Enhanced Blood Textures, Feminine Khajiit Textures etc., because their content is totally different from what we use and just to make my work easier if I decide to change something.

* Changed brightness settings for ENB to be a bit darker in interiors and brighter at nights in exteriors.
