# Changelog

## Version 2.3.1.

**Is save compatible if you haven't started Undeath related content.**

Some fixes, tweaks and additions for the 2.3. version of the modlist.

### Added Mods

* Undeath Classical Lichdom - The Ascension (Lite)
* Equipment Toggle
> You don't even know how happy I am because of this. Allows you to unhide/hide your headgear by pressing `Arrow Down` button. 
* Expressive Werebeasts Redux
> Updated version of Monster Facial Animation.
* KrittaKitty's HD Werewolves
> Werewolf texture replacer for our werewolf form, which is used in TPF too. Tweaked it to be compatible with Expressive Werebeasts Redux, which now makes our werewolf form appear according to our gender too like other werewolves.

### Removed Mods

* Prelude to Purgatory - A Lich Custom Skill Tree
> Decided to give The Ascension a try, considering we now have diversified werevolves too. And probably balance without this one will be better.
* Diverse Werewolves Collection - Player Replacer
* Monster Facial Animation
* Werewolf Eyetracking Behavior

### Changes

* Fixed landscape slopes being invisible during some seasons.
> Some kind of Turn of Seasons shenanigans.
* Fixed Sinding's appearance and behaviour during and after his quest.

### Updated Mods
