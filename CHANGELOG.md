### Interface

* Added _Immersive Fort Dawnguard and Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods Patch_.

### New Content

* Added _3DNPC BSA Replacer_.
* Readded _Beyond Skyrim Bruma - Hotfix_, added additional instructions for it.
> It was stupid to remove it whole just because of one broken mesh. I guess I was worried that maybe something else is broken there too, which I hadn't known about yet.
* Added additional instructions for _Clockwork_, _Undeath_, _Ruska - Riften Player Home_ and _Knight's Rest_.
* Changed installation instructions to _Kaidan 2 Follower Voice Fixes and Additional Dialogue_.

### Exteriors

* Added _Cathedral 3D Mountain Flowers - Base Object Swapper_.
* Added _Fixed Mesh Lighting - Ancient Trees of Skyrim Patch_.

### Appearance

* Removed _Vanilla Hair Replacer_.
> I just didn't like the fact that many of hair for males felt out of place with our high poly head and also that sometimes a weird issue happened, 
where our character's face becomes whitened for a while. So we are just going to use TPF's hair textures together with _High Poly Head_'s hair meshes.
* Changed installation instructions for _High Poly Head_.

### Miscellaneous

* Added _Custom Skills Menu_.

> Not needed anymore without _Vanilla Hair Replacer_.

* Added additional instructions for _End Times_.

### Skeleton & Animations

* Removed _Leviathan Animations - Two-Handed Normal Attacks_, _Vanargand Animations - One Handed Mid Stance_ and _Vanargand Animations - One Handed Normal Attacks_.

* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Pretty Combat Animations_.
* Updated installation and FOMOD instructions for _Pretty One-Handed Animations Overhaul_.
* Updated installation instructions, added FOMOD instructions for _TK Dodge RE_.
> After playing for some time, I have realized that normal attacks were looking like we are swinging not a weapon, but definitely something else. And with the new update of _Pretty One-Handed Animations Overhaul_ I don't feel we need different animations for being idle, running and walking when using one handed weapons.
