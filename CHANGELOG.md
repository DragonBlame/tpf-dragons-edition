# Changelog

## Version 2.2.

With this update comes removal of the manual guide for the fork. It was hard considering that is what made the modlist possible to be made and to be on Wabbajack, but to continue going forward the modlist from this moment becomes exlusive to Wabbajack. That doesn't mean that the direction of my work will go somewhere else. It is needed to actually make my work much more easier and feel less like some kind of accounting job (well, no one reads my _reports_ anyway, so what is the point) and focus more on what would I actually want to do. Somewhere around this year Phoenix will rise (hehe) and you will be able to enjoy her work again, but I hope that my manual guide gave some of you at least a little bit of insight on the mods of Skyrim and how we are making them work.

That means that there are going to be some changes pretty much everywhere in the written part of the modlist starting from this changelog. If you feel that it can be improved, feel free to report in the appropriate channels.

This update was mainly meant to improve appearance of the whole fork, while also giving it more content. Skyrim now changes looks every month, but not other places for now. Also welcome Midwood Isle, Falskaar, More to do in Hammerfell, Frozen in Time and The Wheel of Time. Some of other changes were made too related to the feedback survey I made inside TPF's Discord server (in the WJ server I will only make posts about updates and support users, so feel free to join [TPF's server](https://discord.gg/tpf) if you are interested in learning about everything else related to the modpack). Feel free to took at my [feedback summary report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nI0ElL6VhanV-ll7B4gur2ECQuNcsjJU/view?usp=sharing) to learn more about the results of the survey.

**New save is required.**

* Better Wyrmstooth Map With Roads
* Facegen Output for Random Mods
* The Sinister Seven
> I love the mod, I am fine with enemies coming whenever they come, but it should start more immersively. It is the only mod with this problem now after
Kaidan got his deserved treatment (if we exclude Undeath, which at least starts some time later and has much more content), so I have decided to remove it for consistency.
* Rayek's End
> The mod has a bunch of issues starting from people not being able to download the modpack because of it and ending with not correctly working items, 
so I removed it for now.

### Changes

* Removed manual guide.
* Removed some of TPF's mods, which were completely overwritten by ours.
* Readded full KS Hairdos.
> Because I have gone through it again and chosen good hairstyles for us.
* Overhauled documentation, mainly the gameplay guide.
* Divided miscellaneous mods into more categories. 
* Changed priorities of NPC overhauls.
> If we aren't talking just about removals and additions. That means that NPCs should now look more diverse.
* Made hoods and other type of headgear, which isn't armour, appear much more less on n NPCs.
* Made crosshair and Quick Loot's UI bigger.
> Should make ultrawide users' lives easier too.
* Tweaked Honed Metal.
> Now everything should be just a little bit more expensive and time consuming to balance everything out. 
But you will wait more for common ingredients if NPCs don't have them. It didn't make sense that they got them so fast.

* Added bigger Quick Loot for widescreen users.
