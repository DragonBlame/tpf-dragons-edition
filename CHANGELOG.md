# Changelog

## Version 1.10.

> Updated final patches and all outputs.

### Interface

* Removed _Alternate Conversation Camera Plus_.
> As it was added to TPF. We are also using TPF's default settings for the mod, because many people have actually said that they don't like mine.
* Removed _SmoothCam - Octavian's Preset_. Added _SmoothCam - DocOct Preset_.
> Upgraded version of the preset we have used before.

### New Content

* Added _Nilheim - Misc Quest Expansion_ and _House of Horrors - Quest Expansion_.
* Added _Interesting Follower Requirements for Interesting NPCs_.
* Added _Darkend - Enemy Rebalance_.
* Removed _Identity Crisis_.
> Unfortunately the mod not only makes a bunch of navmesh conflicts and deleted navmeshes, but also is the culprit of making Volkihar Castle not reachable by any means, 
so for now we will say goodbye.
* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Opulent Thieves Guild Patch Collection_.
* Moved _JK's The Ragged Flagon_ to the _Interiors_ section.
* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Additional Clockwork_.
* Changed _The Wheels of Lull_ order.
* Changed installation and FOMOD instructions for _The Wheels of Lull_.

### Exteriors

* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Cities of the North - Winterhold Patch Collection_.
* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Cities of the North - Dawnstar Patch Collection_.

### Interiors

* Removed _Hearthfire - Unique Display Rooms_.
> Taking into consideration that it just adds cellars to our build by ourselves houses without actually doing anything in the places we would have loved to be overhauled and 
that it has deleted navmeshes.
* Added _JK's Temple of Kynareth_.
* Moved _JK's The Ragged Flagon_ here from the _New Content_ section.
* Changed installation instructions for _JK's Elgrims Elixirs_.
* Changed FOMOD instructions for _JK's Interiors Patch Collection_.

### Appearance

* Changed installation and FOMOD instructions for _Masculine Argonian Textures_.

### Gameplay Overhauls

* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul_.

### Miscellaneous

* Removed _Simple Load Screens_. Added _Starlit Lakes Loading Screens_ and _Interesting Loading Screens_.
* Changed installation instructions for _powerofthree's Papyrus Extender_.
* Changed the name for _Player Spell and Weapon Lighting_.
* Changed installation instructions for _Strange Runes_.
* Moved _Talkative Dragons_, _Talkative Dragons - Audio Replacer_ and _BA Bard Songs_ here from the the _Music & Sound FX_ section.

### Music & Sound FX

* Removed _Nordic Shouts - Enigma Series_, _Better Sounding Female Dragon Shouts_, _TPF Dragon's Edition - Music Patch_ and all music mods.
* Moved _Talkative Dragons_, _Talkative Dragons - Audio Replacer_ and _BA Bard Songs_ to the _Miscellaneous_ section.
* Removed the section completely.
> And as the music was added back again to TPF, I don't need to worry about that anymore. 
Conflicts with the quest mods were resolved in my conflict resolution patches. Considering a fact that not all people liked the overhauled shouting voices, the vanilla ones aren't exactly bad and me not wanting to keep this section for just those two mods, I have decided to remove them.

### Skeleton & Animations

* Removed _First Person Combat Animations Overhaul_.
> After playing with it for a while I understood that it is a little bit too much. And then everything else followed.
* Removed _Tiny Improvement for 1st Person Crossbow Animations_.
> With the mod each crossbow was constantly jiggling while being in idle position.
* Removed _Blocking Animation Pack_.
> It just doesn't offer much and much of it conflicts with a new addition.
* Added _Ice Skating Fixed_.
* Added many of Vanargrand and Leviathan animation packs.
* Added _Crosshair-aligned Crossbow_.
* Added 60 mana cost to Tarhiel's Gale. It can be reduced by investing into alteration.
* Changed installation instructions for _TK Dodge RE_.

### ENB

* Changed configurations for interiors' brightness.

### Gameplay Guide

* Changed information about _Darkend_.

---

### Other Changes

* Fixed Laelette's and other vampire black face issues.
* Changed mod order for the _Interface_, _Interiors_, _Apparel & Weapons_, _Gameplay Overhauls_, _Miscellaneous_ and _Skeleton & Animations_ section.
> Just to make more sense.
* Overhauled _Configurations_ section.
* Added _Requirements_ section on the main page of the add-on.
> Mainly because of Microsoft .NET 5.0.
* Removed MCM instructions for _Strange Runes_.
> One of the latest updates finally addressed issues with the mod and NPCs, so we don't need to deactivate runes for NPCs anymore.
