# Changelog

## Version 2.6.

**New save is required.**

New challenger of not giving stable modding experience to its users appeared. VectorPlexus is a place, which is usually associated with High Poly Head (but is about much more... *wink...* but not just about *that*). Unfortunately, due to it being unstable many people just can't install the list and that's why I needed to make a decision to remove all the mods from VectorPlexus at least for now. Fortunately, High Poly Head is also hosted by its author on Google Drive... Armored pants won't be forgotten.

At least that has allowed me to make a not save compatible update, so here we ago. This time honourable mentions are ...

## Added Mods

* Vanilla Script (micro)Optimizations
* Vanilla Scripting Enhancements
* Fixed and Optimized USSEP Valdr Quest

## Removed Mods

* Seasonal Alchemy
> I like how Seasonal Landscapes handles plants.
* Heavy Armored Pants
* SavrenX Vampire Lord Tank
> RIP... I will add them back immedialely if Vectorplexus is going to be in a working condition in the future.

## Changes

* Configured the newest Equipment Toggle to work just on us manually and not to touch shields.
> Like it was before. For now it will be good. You can just not equip helmet on your follower if you would like to see their face as they aren't as dependant on equipment as you.
