* Added _Obscure's College of Winterhold NPC Stuck in Staircase Fix_.

### Exteriors

### Appearance

* Removed _Vanilla Hair Replacer_.
> I just didn't like the fact that many of hair for males felt out of place with our high poly head and also that sometimes a weird issue happened, 
where our character's face becomes whitened for a while. So we are just going to use TPF's hair textures together with _High Poly Head_'s hair meshes.
