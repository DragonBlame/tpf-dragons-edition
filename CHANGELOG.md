# Changelog

## Version 1.10.

> Updated final patches and all outputs.

### Interface

* Removed _Alternate Conversation Camera Plus_.
> As it was added to TPF. We are also using TPF's default settings for the mod, because many people have actually said that they don't like mine.

### New Content

* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Opulent Thieves Guild Patch Collection_.
* Moved _JK's The Ragged Flagon_ to the _Interiors_ section.
* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Additional Clockwork_.
* Changed installation and FOMOD instructions for _The Wheels of Lull_.

### Exteriors

* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Cities of the North - Winterhold Patch Collection_.
* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Cities of the North - Dawnstar Patch Collection_.

### Interiors

* Added _JK's Temple of Kynareth_.
* Moved _JK's The Ragged Flagon_ here from the _New Content_ section.
* Changed installation instructions for _JK's Elgrims Elixirs_.
* Changed FOMOD instructions for _JK's Interiors Patch Collection_.

### Appearance

### Gameplay Overhauls

### Miscellaneous

* Changed the name for _Player Spell and Weapon Lighting_.
* Changed installation instructions for _Strange Runes_.
* Moved _Talkative Dragons_, _Talkative Dragons - Audio Replacer_ and _BA Bard Songs_ here from the the _Music & Sound FX_ section.

### Music & Sound FX

* Removed _Nordic Shouts - Enigma Series_, _Better Sounding Female Dragon Shouts_, _TPF Dragon's Edition - Music Patch_ and all music mods.
* Moved _Talkative Dragons_, _Talkative Dragons - Audio Replacer_ and _BA Bard Songs_ to the _Miscellaneous_ section.
* Removed the section completely.
> And as the music was added back again to TPF, I don't need to worry about that anymore. 
Conflicts with the quest mods were resolved in my conflict resolution patches. Considering a fact that not all people liked the overhauled shouting voices, the vanilla ones aren't exactly bad and me not wanting to keep this section for just those two mods, I have decided to remove them.

### Skeleton & Animations

* Removed _First Person Combat Animations Overhaul_.
> After playing with it for a while I understood that it is a little bit too much. And then everything else followed.
* Removed _Tiny Improvement for 1st Person Crossbow Animations_.
> With the mod each crossbow was constantly jiggling while being in idle position.
* Removed _Blocking Animation Pack_.
> It just doesn't offer much and much of it conflicts with a new addition.
* Added many of Vanargrand and Leviathan animation packs.
* Added _Crosshair-aligned Crossbow_.
* Changed installation instructions for _TK Dodge RE_.

### ENB

* Changed configurations for interiors' brightness.

---

### Other Changes

* Changed mod order for the _Interface_, _Interiors_, _Apparel & Weapons_, _Gameplay Overhauls_, _Miscellaneous_ and _Skeleton & Animations_ section.
> Just to make more sense.
* Removed MCM instructions for _Strange Runes_.
> One of the latest updates finally addressed issues with the mod and NPCs, so we don't need to deactivate runes for NPCs anymore.

### Wabbajack

* Changed the instructions for Wabbajack users, which were related to the optional mods.
> As the _Music & Sound FX_ section was removed, there is only the _Interface_ section left.
* Removed unpacked scripts.
* Changed brightness in interiors.
> Those are just a little bit more brighter now, which is still darker than default values.
