# Changelog

## Version 2.3.1.

**Is save compatible if you haven't started Undeath related content (you haven't become you know whom).**

Some fixes, tweaks and additions for the 2.3. version of the modlist.

### Added Mods

* Narrative Gameplay Consistent Dialogue Tweaks
* Sensible Sleepwalking - Wake up at nearest All-Maker Stone
* Undeath Classical Lichdom - The Ascension (Lite)
* Interesting NPCs SE (3DNPC) - Bard Fix
* Spiders of Solstheim - Transparency Fix
* Spiders of Solstheim - ENB Light
* Equipment Toggle
> You don't even know how happy I am because of this. Allows you to unhide/hide your headgear by pressing `Arrow Down` button. 
* EVG Animation Variance
* Immersive Folded Hands
* Conditional Tavern Cheering
* Dialogue Animation Remix
* Expressive Werebeasts Redux
> Updated version of Monster Facial Animation.
* KrittaKitty's HD Werewolves
> Werewolf texture replacer for our werewolf form, which is used in TPF too. Tweaked it to be compatible with Expressive Werebeasts Redux, which now makes our werewolf form appear according to our gender too like other werewolves.

### Removed Mods

* Prelude to Purgatory - A Lich Custom Skill Tree
> Decided to give The Ascension a try, considering we now have diversified werevolves too. They can't be used together. And probably balance without this one will be better.
* Diverse Werewolves Collection - Player Replacer
* Monster Facial Animation
* Werewolf Eyetracking Behavior

### Changes

* Removed runes from ward spells _(will work only on new games, can be done by yourself using MCM)_.
* Removed `.` button as the shortcut to our custom perks _(will work only on new games)_.
> Now it is just `Tab` button.
* Fixed landscape slopes being invisible during some seasons.
> Some kind of Turn of Seasons shenanigans.
* Fixed Sinding's appearance and behaviour during and after his quest.
* Fixed the horse whistle for Frost and Shadowmere.
> I hope. Be sure to tell me if it works for them now.
> For unknown reasons, both ward and rune animations are casted for players together. Also it is hard to see what is going on when you play in the first person mode with the runes
from wards.
* Changed the thieves guild quest, so now you can give gold only to beggars.

### Updated Mods

* Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul
* Faster HDT-SMP
