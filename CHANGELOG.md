# Changelog

## Version 1.13.

> Updated final patches. Updated DynDOLOD and Occlusion outputs.

### New Content

* Added _Helgen Reborn Immersive Start_.
* Added _Kaidan 2 - HD Armor Retexture_.
* Changed installation instructions for _Beyond Skyrim - Bruma_.
* Changed installation instructions for _Tools of Kagrenac_.

### Exteriors

* Added _Ancient Trees Of Skyrim_.

### Interiors

### Apparel & Weapons

* Removed _KD Circlets Redone_.
> The mod was deleted from SE Nexus. It is still on LE Nexus, but I have decided not to readd it.

### Miscellaneous

* Removed _Civil War Neutrality_.
* Added _Neutral Hjerim_.
> _Civil War Neutrality_ was a good mod, but unfortunately it needs update to function properly. With the mod installed, people actually coudn't join the factions even if they wanted to join. At least we will be able to get Hjerim without the need to join the war (getting rid of the psycopath actually is somehow rewarded from the side of the city in this way).
* Added _VioLens - A Killmove Mod_ and _VioLens - A Killmove Mod - Settings Loader_.

### Skeleton & Animations

* Removed _Vanargand Animations - Sneak Idle Walk and Run_.
> After tinkering with them for a while, I understood that I actually don't like them too.

### NPC Overhauls

* Removed _Updated USSEP - Pandorable's NPC Overhauls - AI Overhaul Patches' Compendium_.
* Changed installation instructions for _Pandorable's NPCs - Dawnguard_, _Pandorable's NPCs - Males_ and _Pandorable's NPCs - Males 2_.

### Other Changes

* Moved Falkreath's carriage driver's knapsacks and the lantern not to fly around.

### Wabbajack

* Removed not needed copies of some mods.
* Changed colours for my separators and for some of TPF's separators.
> To bring those to the right colour, which is used everywhere else in the add-on. For TPF's separators it was done mainly to make my work a little bit easier - it indicates, where are the mods, which are from TPF, but were reinstalled with different settings for the add-on's purposes.
