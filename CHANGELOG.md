# Changelog

## Version 1.15.

> Updated final patches. Updated Nemesis and DynDOLOD and Occlusion outputs.

### Exteriors

* Added _Cathedral 3D Mountain Flowers - Base Object Swapper_.

### Appearance

* Removed _Vanilla Hair Replacer_.
> I just didn't like the fact that many of hair for males felt out of place with our high poly head and also that sometimes a weird issue happened, 
where our character's face becomes whitened for a while. So we are just going to use TPF's hair textures together with _High Poly Head_'s hair meshes.
* Changed installation instructions for _High Poly Head_.

### Miscellaneous

* Removed _Face Discoloration Fix_.
> Not needed anymore without _Vanilla Hair Replacer_.
* Added _Base Object Swapper_.
* Changed installation instructions for _VioLens - A Killmove Mod_ (undocumented 1.14. addition).

### Skeleton & Animations

* Added FOMOD instructions, updated installation and INI instructions for _TK Dodge RE_.
