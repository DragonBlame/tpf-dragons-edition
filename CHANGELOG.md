# Changelog

## Version 2.5.

**New safe is required.**

This big chungus brings us... many things.
From now on, thanks to the mod Seasonal Landscapes with our combination of other mods, our seasons look even more diverse and actually much more close to what I have wanted to see right at the beginning - eye candy. Tried my luck to make it even better by making insects and farm and some other plants seasonal too, but unfortunately with no luck for now. Maybe that will come later, but for now we have still many things to enjoy. Welcome crossbows related creation content, which is integrated to the whole Skyrim in a way, in which many NPCs will finally also use crossbows.

Honourable mentions this time are our new argonian duo Lucifer and Xelzaz, who can accompany you to different kinds of adventures. Let's not forget about Remiel with her unique supporting capabilities. You will be able to find them all, while travelling around Skyrim. Finally thistle and tundra cotton join mountain flowers on not being flat vagon, what surely will ehance someone's screenshots, while new aspen trees and bent pines in snow upgrade views for another 200%. And the last, but not least are RedBag's Dragonsreach, which makes JK's Dragonreach even more gorgeous by adding various custom made decorations to it, and Elysium Estate, another beautiful house for you, item hoarders.

And another reminder about the lists' preset competition, which is still happening in the TPF's Discord server. Be sure to join if you want to feature your work in the add-on and to win a 30 EUR (32 USD) worth Steam game. All the rules are pinned inside _#tpf-de-competitions_ channel.

> After reading a comment of a user saying that we need a home somewhere around the tutorial area, I agreed. Thou it was my second choice, I find it pretty. Other variants were Lake Haven and Leaf Rest, but Lake Haven is incompatible with one of the content mods we are using, so I didn't even bother checking it further, while Leaf Rest (my first candidate) is perfect, but a nightmare for consistency patching (I have tried...).

## Removed Mods

* Markarth HD Retexture
> For TPF the same changes were made for dwemer related meshes and textures if we exclude this mod (I guess that means I understand a thing or two about choosing textures).
* Patches for Ancient Dwemer Metal and new content mods
> Our usual dwemer weapons use different assets for changing their appearance, so we are fine without these. 
* The Paarthurnax Resolution
* Apachii Divine Elegance Store - UNP Meshes
> They didn't affect us anyhow negatively, because UNP is pretty close to vanilla body we are using, but there is no need for this patch now.

* Seasons of Skyrim - Remove Unwanted Grass
* Shrubs of Snow
> The last two are just not needed with Seasonal Landscapes.
