# Changelog

## Version 1.14.

> Updated final patches. Updated DynDOLOD and Occlusion outputs.

### Improved Vanilla Content

* Moved many mods here from _New Content_.
> The new section was made to make everything more structured and less cluttered in _New Content_.

### New Content

* Changed mod and load order.
> Overall just a cosmetic change to make my work easier and for it all to make more sense.
* Moved many mods to _Improved Vanilla Content_.

### Exteriors

* Removed _The Great Cities - Minor Cities and Towns_ and each patch related to it.
> I should have done long time ago. Even thou the mod makes non-existant vanilla versions of towns look like actual towns befitting their story, it felt like a compatibility nightmare, which was following me all this time I have decided to add it. _Cities of the North_ series already do great job on helping these towns become unique and we still have _The Great Cities_ series for even smaller places unlike Falkreath and other capitals of the holds. Now I am finally in peace with this section of the add-on.

### Miscellaneous

* Removed _Less Boring Loading Screen_.
> The mod's loading screens were definitely less boring than the vanilla ones, but at the same time some of them were very low quality too. 
I will use just _Starlit Lakes Loading Screens_ for consistency and because they are the closest to what I would like to see (they are (star)lit).
