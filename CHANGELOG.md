# Changelog

## Version 2.0.

> Updated final patches. Updated Nemesis, Texgen and DynDOLOD and Occlusion outputs.

### Interface

* Removed _Weather of World_.

### Improved Vanilla Content

* Added _Obscure's College of Winterhold NPC Stuck in Staircase Fix_.

### New Content

* Added _3DNPC BSA Replacer_.
* Changed installation instructions to _Kaidan 2 Follower Voice Fixes and Additional Dialogue_.

### Exteriors

* Added _Treerific_.
> Just wouch.
* Added _Cathedral 3D Mountain Flowers - Base Object Swapper_.

### Appearance

* Removed _Vanilla Hair Replacer_.
> I just didn't like the fact that many of hair for males felt out of place with our high poly head and also that sometimes a weird issue happened, 
where our character's face becomes whitened for a while. So we are just going to use TPF's hair textures together with _High Poly Head_'s hair meshes.
* Changed installation instructions for _High Poly Head_.

### Miscellaneous

* Removed _Face Discoloration Fix_.
> Not needed anymore without _Vanilla Hair Replacer_.
* Added _Base Object Swapper_.
* Added _Improved Loading Screen Colors_.
* Added additional instructions for _End Times_.

### Skeleton & Animations

* Added _XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended - Settings Loader_.
* Removed _Leviathan Animations - Two-Handed Normal Attacks_, _Vanargand Animations - One Handed Mid Stance_ and _Vanargand Animations - One Handed Normal Attacks_.
* Updated installation instructions, added FOMOD instructions for _TK Dodge RE_.
* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Pretty Combat Animations_.
* Updated installation and FOMOD instructions for _Pretty One-Handed Animations Overhaul_.
> After playing for some time, I have realized that normal attacks were looking like we are swinging not a weapon, but definitely something else. And with the new update of _Pretty One-Handed Animations Overhaul_ I don't feel we need different animations for being idle, running and walking when using one handed weapons.
