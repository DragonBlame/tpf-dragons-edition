# Changelog

## Version 2.6.

**New save is required.**

New challenger of not giving stable modding experience to its users appeared. VectorPlexus is a place, which is usually associated with High Poly Head (but is about much more... *wink...* but not just about *that*). Unfortunately, due to it being unstable many people just can't install the list and that's why I needed to make a decision to remove all the mods from VectorPlexus at least for now. RIP, armored pants, they won't be forgotten.

At least that has allowed me to make a not save compatible update, so here we ago.

## Added Mods

* JK's Sinderion's Field Laboratory
* Supreme Vampire Lords
* Vampire Lord Body Reworked

## Removed Mods

* Heavy Armored Pants
* SavrenX Vampire Lord Tank
> RIP... I will add them back immedialely if Vectorplexus is going to be in a working condition in the future.
