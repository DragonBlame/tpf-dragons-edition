# Changelog

## Version 1.14.

> Updated final patches. Updated Texgen, DynDOLOD and Occlusion outputs.

### Improved Vanilla Content

* Moved many mods here from _New Content_.
> The new section was made to make everything more structured and less cluttered in _New Content_.
* Removed _Opulent Thieves Guild Patch Collection_.
* Added _Weather of World_.
* Changed FOMOD instructions for _Obscure's College of Winterhold_.
* Changed installation instructions for _Briraka's Draugr Overhaul - Cannibal Draugr Patch_.

### New Content

* Removed _Beyond Skyrim - Bruma Hotfix_.
> In short, it hotfixed Skyrim not giving you CTDs in Falkreath. Bruma's team still has a lot of work to do.
* Removed _Beyond Skyrim - Bruma Tree LOD billboards_, _Imperial City LOD for Beyond Skyrim - Bruma_ and _Gray Cowl of Nocturnal - Alikr Flora Overhaul Tree Billboards_.
> I have actually completely forgotten that billboards are now generated automatically by DynDOLOD.
* Added _Moonpath of Elsweyr - Apothecary Patch_.
> Added additional instructions for _FaceGen Output for Random Mods_.
* Changed installation instructions for _Interesting NPCs (3DNPC)_.
* Changed mod and load order.
> Overall just a cosmetic change to make my work easier and for it all to make more sense.
* Moved many mods to _Improved Vanilla Content_.

### Exteriors

* Removed _The Great Cities - Minor Cities and Towns_ and each patch related to it.
> I should have done that long time ago. Even thou the mod makes non-existant vanilla versions of towns look like actual towns befitting their story and defences, it felt like a compatibility nightmare, which was following me all this time I have decided to add it. _Cities of the North_ series already do great job on helping these towns become unique and we still have _The Great Cities_ series for even smaller places unlike Falkreath and other capitals of the holds. Now I am finally in peace with this section of the add-on.

### Miscellaneous

* Removed _Less Boring Loading Screen_.
> The mod's loading screens were definitely less boring than the vanilla ones, but at the same time some of them were very low quality too. 
I will use just _Starlit Lakes Loading Screens_ for consistency and because they are the closest to what I would like to see (and they are (star)lit).

### Skeleteon & Animations

* Changed installation instructions for _Finally First Person Magic Animation_.

---

### Other Changes

* Fixed CTDs at Falkreath.
> Was related to _Beyond Skyrim - Bruma Hotfix_, which was removed for now.
* Now the game gives you 3 perk points at level 2.
> Compensation for not being able to utilize _Locksmith_ perk.
* Lightning in some places (Castle Volkihar, Thieves Guild) should now be more in place with the changed looks of the places.
* And many other good things I won't be able to write down here (for real).

### Updated Add-on's Mods for Wabbajack Users

* Navigator - Navmesh Fixes
* Finally First Person Magic Animation
