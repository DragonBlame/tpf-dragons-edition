# Changelog

## Version 2.3.2.1.

**Is save compatible.**

Because unfortunately the mod we have used for adjusting our height in the first person isn't as good as I have thought before and it was always causing one annoying issue, which we will deal with now.

## Added Mods

* Improved Camera
* Improved Camera Custom .ini
> Tweaked it too a little bit.

## Removed Mods

* First Person Camera Height Fix
