## About Wabbajack

Wabbajack allows you to install my modpack to your PC by duplicating my setup directly to your PC, including each mod, setting, output etc. If you want to learn more about Wabbajack in general, refer to Phoenix's article, [_About Wabbajack_](https://thephoenixflavour.com/wj/about-wabbajack/).

## Game Setup

Phoenix also wrote a very detailed instructions on [how to set up your Skyrim Special Edition correctly for any Wabbajack list](https://thephoenixflavour.com/wj/wj-sse/game-setup/) and also for [installing those lists through Wabbajack](https://thephoenixflavour.com/wj/wj-sse/list-installation/). Follow those instructions carefully until you reach the _Choosing a list_ section of the list installation instructions. Then follow the instructions written below.

## Installation

For now The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon's Edition isn't listed in the Wabbajack Gallery and needs to be installed manually. Download `The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon's Edition.wabbajack` file from Google Drive and then continue following the list installation instructions, but instead of choosing _Browse Modlists_, click _Install from Disk_ and select The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon's Edition.wabbajack from a place, where you have saved it. Then continue following the instructions until finishing going through _Game Folder Files_ section.

## Configurations

In game folder files by now you have found 3 ENB options for you to choose from:
  - _Serio's ENB_, which is used in TPF by default;
  - _Cathedral Minimalist ENB_ with Phoenix's tweaks for more performance;
  - [_Silent Horizons ENB_](https://github.com/DragonBlame/tpf-dragons-edition/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md#enb), which I prefer now and a recommend for you to try.

You will have 4 available profiles in your installation, so you can play both TPF and my add-on on the same installation:
  - _The Phoenix Flavour_;
  - _The Phoenix Flavour (Performance)_, which uses different performance tweaks to make experience better for users with low end PCs;
  - _The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon's Edition_;
  - _The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon's Edition (Performance)._

Change profiles by clicking on an already active profile and choosing another profile.

While following the main documentation of the add-on, users have a choice to use or not to use two sections' mods, which are [_Interface_](https://github.com/DragonBlame/tpf-dragons-edition/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md#interface-optional) section and [_Music & Sound FX_](https://github.com/DragonBlame/tpf-dragons-edition/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md#music--sound-fx-optional) section. For Wabbajack users two of those sections are enabled by default, but if you don't like a mod or two from there, you are free to disable them according to provided instructions in the documentation.
