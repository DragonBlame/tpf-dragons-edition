## About Wabbajack

Wabbajack allows you to install my modpack to your PC by duplicating my setup directly to your PC, including each mod, setting, output etc. If you want to learn more about Wabbajack in general, refer to Phoenix's article, [_About Wabbajack_](https://thephoenixflavour.com/wj/about-wabbajack/).

## Game Setup

Phoenix also wrote a very detailed instructions on [how to set up your Skyrim Special Edition correctly for any Wabbajack list](https://thephoenixflavour.com/wj/wj-sse/game-setup/) and also for [installing those lists through Wabbajack](https://thephoenixflavour.com/wj/wj-sse/list-installation/). Follow those instructions carefully until you reach the _Choosing a list_ section of the list installation instructions. Then follow the instructions written below.

## Installation

For now The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon's Edition isn't listed in the Wabbajack Gallery and needs to be installed manually. Download `The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon's Edition.wabbajack` file from Google Drive and then continue following the list installation instructions, but instead of choosing _Browse Modlists_, click _Install from Disk_ and select The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon's Edition.wabbajack from a place, where you have saved it. Then continue following the instructions until finishing going through _Game Folder Files_ section.
