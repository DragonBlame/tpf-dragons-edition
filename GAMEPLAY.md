# Gameplay Guide

This guide highlights major gameplay mods included in The Phoenix Flavour - Dragon's Edition, while also giving you some pointers on how to start your new adventures. 
Consider it as **one big spoiler** for the content added and so you have been warned.

## Alternate Start

[Ralof or Hadvar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14553) allows us to skip the carriage drive and enter right into Helgen’s Keep with Ralof or Hadvar. 
In some way it isn't an alternate start, but at the same time it is. What matters is this mod’s simplicity, which allows us to jump right into the action.

## Gameplay Overhauls

Overall:
  - Like in vanilla, you are limited to one follower at a time (if we don't count followers with their own unique AI like Inigo and Lucien).
  - Leveling is slower than in vanilla, but you receive more perk points as you level up.
  - Combat is more difficult than in vanilla, but feels more fair.

If you want to go deeper, The Phonix Flavour - Dragon's Edition includes several Simon Magus' overhauls to core gameplay system, which greatly improve the experience, but at the same time stay as close to their origins as possible:

- [Aetherius - A Race Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686);
- [Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487);
- [Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549) - Adjusts the difficulty modifiers, slightly increasing incoming damage. With those changes, combat will feel noticably more difficult than vanilla to the point where you may be one-shot by certain enemy types. Facing mages without any magic resist enchantments or potions can be perilous.
- [Adamant - A Perk Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191) - Some key features include spells and perks that finally scale and remain strong options in the late game, shouts that will also scale in strength based on your Speech level and advance your Speech skill, removal of Arcane Blacksmith perk and its availability for payer right from the beginning, splitting the smithing perk tree into a crafting and a tempering branch
and perks that activate when wearing a full set of heavy or light armor work with only three pieces worn (no need for a helmet).
- [Hand To Hand - An Adamant Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790) - Merges Lockpicking and Pickpocketing into a single skill and adds a new perk tree for Hand to Hand combat. Merging Lockpicking and Pickpocketing into a single tree improves thief gameplay by reducing the number of non-combat skills that players need to invest in. It also creates space to add a new, fully integrated perk tree for Hand to Hand. This allows for full support for unarmed combat as a legitimate and competitive gameplay style, while also untethering unarmed from either light or heavy armor.
- [Mundus - A Standing Stone Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411);
- [Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130);
- [Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138);
- [Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) - After you pray at the shrine, you won't get cured from any disease, but 
you will get a power to pray everywhere, not only near shrines. Like always, when you do so, you get unique power from the deity you were praying to, but 
a more unique one than those you get in vanilla. You can even take those powers further by obtaining two new perks in your Restoration or Conjuration tree.
- [Manbeast - A Werewolf Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746);
- [Scion - A Vampire Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639).

Then there are some additional overhauls, which compliment these changes:

- [Adamant Perks for NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47484) - Adds some of the perks from our perk overhaul to a little amount of NPCs to make them stronger. No more unique strength from perks just for our player character.
- [Smart NPC Potions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40102) - Finally bandits, mages and assassins will also have an option to have
and use some potions. And not just healing potions, which they already use in vanilla to, to make our lives a little bit harder.
- [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681) - Rebalance of Skyrim's loot system. It attempts to maintain the same open world feel of Skyrim while adjusting the levels certain items appear and makes it so daedric and other special weapons must be acquired from special quests only. No longer will iron equipment be completely irrelevant in a matter of a few hours.
- [Simple Smithing Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47115);
- [Honed Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61015) - You are a person, who is destined to save the world, but to even do that you have to become the best blacksmith and/or enchanter in Skyrim too to craft a decent equipment to rely on. This can't be immersive for each and every Dragonborn, so let's make NPCs take care of that, 
while introducing some disadvantages of getting gear with help of others such as their services being costly and taking time to complete. 
- [Timing is Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464) - Adjusts some quests to start at a later time to improve their balance as some quests have been made harder.
- [Radiant Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45427) - Modifies radiant quests so that they don't send you to locations with dangerous enemies until your level is high enough.
- [No Lockpicking](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32218) - The end of the annoying lockpicking game. Now your actual lockpicking skill is used to pick a lock, which make the skill much more useful. Locks will break according to your skill too. For example, if you are a novice at lockpicking and you try to pick a novice lock, 
you will have only 40% chance to break a lockpick. That's the easiest lock you can pick, so that is pretty fair for both balance and roleplay. 
But if you as total rookie will try to pick a master lock, be prepared to lose 15 lockpicks. Sounds reasonable for me, maybe you should lose even more.
And that also works in other way - if you are a master thief (your lockpicking skill is big enough), 
you will get only 40% chance to break a lockpick on almost any chest.
- [Reading Is Good](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4202) - Makes us become smarter in an immersive way by giving us a permanent boost to a leveling speed in a skill, which we have read about.
- [Forceful Tongue - Shouts Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36276).

## New Mechanics

* [Dodging](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56956) - `Mouse 4` button is chosen by default for dodging.

If you want to change the button for dodging, do the following:

1. Press on `SKELETON & ANIMATIONS EXTENDED` separator.
2. Double click on `TK Dodge RE` mod.
3. Choose `INI files` tab.
4. Press on `SKSE\Plugins\TK Dodge RE.ini`.
5. In line 5, change _DodgeHotkey_ parameter according to instructions found [here](https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Input_Script#DXScanCodes) after _=_ sign.
> Because of some kind of Skyrim's oddities, each button there is actually one unit smaller than in any other game or program. For example, _Mouse 4_ button is actually _Mouse 3_ button according to the Creation Kit's documentation. Take that into consideration.
6. Press on `Save` button.

* [Crouch sliding](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39157) - While sprinting, you can press `Ctrl` button to perform crouch slide. Useful, when you need to hide as fast as possible or get to some kind of barrier between you and enemy while dodging projectiles.
* [Upgraded horses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50250) - Realistic (faster) horse speed and better handling for horse riding. Increased base stamina of all horses.
* [Horses for followers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45500) - All vanilla stables have a second horse for sale that you can buy from them when you have a vanilla follower. All buyable player horse are flagged as protected and behave cowardly.
* [Paragliding] - Be sure to travel around Falkreath. Something interesting might happen. When you get the paraglider, toggle paraglider by pressing your activation key 
(`E` by default), while in the air. Use your shout key (`Z` by default) to fly higher. Paraglider can be used only in the third person.
* [Respeccing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1960) - Buy _Draught of Fate Unwound_ at Elgrim’s Elixirs in Riften to automatically refund all your perks upon consuming it.
* [New powers for Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41950) - After finishing _The Way of the Voice_, you will unlock an interesting power, which gives you access to a completely new perk tree. 
You will be able to upgrade this power by shouting and killing dragons. Accessible by pressing `.` button. Console users can access it by using the tween menu.

## Utility Tools and Quality of Life Additions

* [Camera's side](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252) - Change camera's side by using your `Mouse 5` key. If you don't mouse with many buttons, feel free to change bindings in _Smoothcam_'s mod configuration menu in _Thirdperson_ tab.
* [Headtracking](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19189) - Press your `V` key to disable or enable headtracking at any time.
* [Animated shouts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50559) - Press your right _Alt_ key to disable or enable animated shouts at any time.
* **About AddItemMenu item in your inventory** - If you recall, we have added a mod, which makes it possible to test all items other mods have to
offer inside their plugins. I have added it for people to know that there is an option like that and for your own testing purposes (can't decide, which armour I would like to get more, let me see and then I will reload my earlier save). I hope you won’t use it for cheating.
* **About different kinds of clothing on NPCs each playthrough** - Dope, right? This change makes NPCs and towns much more lively.
* **About binding items** - Now you can bind not just one item to one button, but much more. If you want to learn more, click [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27184).
* **About forgetting your older spells** - Now you can forget spells you don't use anymore by going into the spells menu and pressing _R_ button.
* **About automatically changing outfits according to different scenarios** - _Diziet' Auto Outfits_ makes you automatically change your outfit according to different conditions, which can be configured inside the mod's MCM. For example, I use it to change my default gear to ordinary clothing with speech etc. enchantments for traders, when I am inside big cities.
* **About lockpicking** - Now you don't need to do the annoying lockpicking game anymore. Now your actual lockpicking skill is used to pick a lock, which make the skill much more useful too. Locks will break according to your skill too. For example, if you are a novice at lockpicking and you try to pick a novice lock, 
you will have only 40% chance to break a lockpick. That's the easiest lock you can pick, so that is pretty fair for both balance and roleplay. 
But if you as total rookie will try to pick a master lock, be prepared to lose 15 lockpicks. Sounds reasonable for me, maybe you should lose even more.
And that also works in other way - if you are a master thief (your lockpicking skill is big enough), 
you will get only 40% chance to break a lockpick on almost any chest.
* **About reading** - Now you will get experience boost to your leveling speed in a skill, which you have read about. 
* **About different coins** - Now there are much more different coins around Skyrim, which will then be converted to their value in septims, when you pick them up.
* **About bribing** - Now it depends on our speech skill too. Be prepared to actually pay if you aren't talkative enough. 
* **About stealing** - Now you need to be crouched to steal items, which aren't the ones in containers. Finally I won't steal something by accident.
* **About knocking** - Now you can knock on locked doors by activating them. Good for roleplaying and also useful.
* **About Clairvoyance (_Guiding Wisp_ now)** - Now it is much more useful overall. Just try it out (be sure that you have an active quest in your journal).
* **About being underwater** - Now you cee your oxygen meter while underwater, so you will know how much time you have before comitting to drowning.
* **About NPC crafting and enchanting services** - Now you can ask different smiths and mages of Skyrim to craft or enchant for you, but, of course, there are drawbacks - their services are pretty costly and take time. 
* **About buying Hjerim without joining the war** - Now it is enough to just take the care of the Butcher.
* **About Aela** - Now Aela in a way is much more unique than other followers. Pick her on a tough adventure to learn how.
* **About werewolves** - Now there are much more of them than in vanilla Skyrim. And be accurate as now there is another way of becoming a werewolf, which you will maybe discover after fighting with them.
* **About sun and being a vampire** - Now you can be safe from sun the same way as Serana by wearing any kind of head gear on you (circlets don't count).
* **About College of Winterhold** - Now you will actually need magic to beat College of Winterhold. You have been warned. Conjured minions, enhanced weapons, illusion, of course, destruction magic, shouts. Good, old steel isn't as reliable now.
* **About getting armored pants** - You will be able to get these in exchange for their counterparts (heavy armors) in Skyrim. Just use any forge for that.
* **About cleaning up your mess** - Now if you have accidentally Fus Ro Dah'ed the Jarl's palace, find a broom and activate it in your inventory.
* **About Lydia** - If the new Lydia is too noisy for you, feel free to change her comment frequency in _Improved Follower Dialogue_ MCM.
* **About Cured Serana Patch** - If you cure Serana from her vampirism in the future, remember to save the game, close it and then in MO2 enable the patch, which you will be able to find inside the _NPC Overhauls_ separator. Then you can safely continue the game and you will see that Serana actually looks like human now.
* **About your character's light adjustments** - You will need to use _AddItemMenu_ again, but this time type the word `light`. _Character Light_ allows use to make better screenshots if we want lightning of our character to be a bit different and can also be used in an ordinary gameplay if you wish as the mod doesn't use scripts. It works even on followers, but then you should give them the corresponding NPC lightning item.
* **Inigo's Whistle Key** - You can issue commands to Inigo by whistling to him. This ability is introduced during his quests and will be explained in-game. 
You will need to press `,` button to use the whistle in the game.

And now just a little heads up and how and when and how you should start newly
added quests. They can be split between early
and mid game and late game ones, because their difficulty slightly
differs.

## New Quests

### Early and Mid Game Quests

* **Winterhold Deep Sea Ruins** - Can be started any time by going northeast
from Winterhold. A journal can be found there in small ruins, which will
point you to the location with a ship marker. Should be done without a
follower.
* **Clockwork** - Automatically after reaching level 5. Without a follower.
* **Beyond Skyrim - Bruma** - Can be started any time in *Pale Pass* (will be
marked as two rocks together) southeast of Helgen. Personally recommend to start it at level 10. 
Some zones further from where you start the mod's quest will be much harder in the beginning like in Skyrim.
* **Moonpath to Elsweyr** - Can be started any time in Bruma’s *Greenwood*,
the southernmost point of County Bruma.
* **Moon and Star** - Automatically after finishing the main quest *The Way of the Voice.*
* **Carved Bink** - After reaching level 10 in *Abandoned Grotto* west of Lost
Knife Hideout.
* **Project AHO** - After reaching level 15, head to Braidwood Inn (located at Kynesgrove) and talk to the innkeeper. Without a follower.
* **The Wheels of Lull** - Automatically after reaching level 20, can be finished after reaching level 35.
* **Helgen Reborn** - **Must** be started after 5 days after you have finished the main quest *Unbound*. 
Recommended to be started at level 20. Read a note called *Helgen Reborn* in The Bannered Mare to start the quest.
* **The Tools of Kagrenac** - Join College of Winterhold and finish the
side questline *Arniel’s Endeavor*. You’ll also need to have finished
*The Way of the Voice*. A couple of days after you completed *Arniel’s
Endeavor* and claimed _Keening_, the quest will start automatically. Make
sure you have Keening in your inventory, it will turn into a quest item
when the mod starts.
* **The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal** - After reaching level 20 and after
pickpocketing or stealing anything. Level 30-35 is recommended, for
thief characters (sneaking and pickpocketing).

### Late Game Quests

* **Darkend** - Can be started any time in *Voyager's End* north of Ysgramor's
Tomb. While generic enemies can be not as tough, the bosses will kick your ass.
At least level 15 is recommended from the author, I recommend at least level 35 even with the patches, which nerf the bosses. Without a follower.
* **Undeath** - Automatically without anything happening after reaching level
30 (I know, not immersive, unfortunately the patch for making it start
in a better way was removed from Nexus, going to deal with that later,
the late game quest, considered you should have gotten it after one
Dragonborn quest).
* **The Forgotten City** - Automatically after reaching level 40. The story
responds to your character’s individual history, actions, so a high
level of speech skill (approximately 60) is also recommended. Enemies
will be pretty tough, but not as tough as within other late game quests.
That’s and also the immersiveness is the reason for setting this quest
requirements as high, because by default it starts at level 5. Without a
follower.
* **The Ice Blade of the Monarch** - Can be started any time in *Pilgrim's
Trench* northeast of The Tower Stone, hard mod.
* **The Tournament of the Ten Bloods** - Can be started after reading *The
Story of Lyrisius* in the Arcanaeum, hard mod.
* **Wyrmstooth** - automatically after Level 10 and after finishing the main
quest *A Blade in the Dark*. According to the official guide book, it
can be challenging even for level 70 characters. It is also recommended
to be prepared before venturing into the quest with some potions and
arrows if you are an archer.
* **The Grand Paladin** - After reading a book *The Grand Paladin* in Bards
College or Skaal's Village Great Hall and after
finishing the main quest *Dragon Rising*. Having more than 300 health is
highly recommended. PC must be able to shout, very hard mod.
* **The Final Cataclysm** - Automatically after reaching level 50 and after
finishing the main quest *The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller*. Stealth and
combat oriented character required, very hard mod. After reaching level
60, a bonus quest becomes available.

I have tried to write as little information as I could so as not to
spoil the content. Won’t tell you any details about your potential new
followers and other surprises as they should be discovered pretty easily
while exploring. I hope if you were surprised (in a good way) about something and this section helped to learn about that a bit more.

But at first, some juicy tips for peeps, who went right here after mingling with the add-on:

* Be sure to do the main quest series as some added quests are tied to it (more information later).
* For people, who would want to adopt children and live with them (and/or with your spouse) not in vanilla homes, 
there will be a neat spell book waiting for you somewhere around Riverwood.
* And another one - be sure to travel around Falkreath. Something interesting might happen.

At second, later into the game, if you are planning to use shields or two-handed weapons, I recommend you to to go into the console with _~_ key, 
type `showracemenu`, press *Enter* and make corrections to your gear's position using settings you can again see below. 
Feel free to configure any other gear while using **only** these settings. **Don't** change any other settings. Also don’t overdo these or animations will look funky. 
And for all our sakes - **don't** change your race, gender or name mid-game - that won't make the game happy. After setting up the settings, press *R* and *Enter* and you are done.

At third, look at some of these additional MCM configurations if you wish:

* **Cond. Expressions** - Disable out of stamina, in pain,
headache/diseased expressions. It can look odd if our character is constantly sad and in pain.
* **Hide Your Quests** - I recommend to hide right away all quests you get
right at the beginning except the main one (Unbound), because you mustn't
start Helgen Reborn quest right at the beginning (read further to learn why) and because The Sinister Seven quest isn’t the one
where you go to objective, just hide it, quest givers will look for you
when a time comes and then you can unhide it. Tried to understand how to make the quest with
Thalmor involved appear after you finish Diplomatic Immunity quest for
immersiveness, but couldn't, will look at that later, so let it be this
way - you heard about what is happening from elves when you were trying
to cross Skyrim’s border. You can do it as fast as you want, but enemies
won’t be the easiest ones to beat. I would recommend getting at least
level 15. Don't forget to unhide the quests, when you actually would want and would be able to start them.
